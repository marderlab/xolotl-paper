`xolotl` is an open-source neuronal simulator written in `C++` with `MATLAB` wrappers. Complex models and networks can be designed efficiently using an intuitive language tightly coupled to the object-based architecture of the underlying `C++` code. Models are specified by adding conductances to compartment objects. The structure is modular, serialized, and searchable, permitting high-level programmatic control over nearly all features of the models. `C++` templates are provided for developing new conductances, compartments, and integration schemata. `xolotl` readily implements parallel-processing on multicore processors and high-performance computing clusters. It also includes a customizable graphical user interface (`puppeteer`) for rapid prototyping and hand-tuning conductances in real-time. In addition, `xolotl` comes packaged with a powerful optimization toolbox (`procrustes`) for optimizing any model parameters accessible in the `xolotl` tree. The modular structure and accessibility to all parameters, variables, and dynamics of the model network in `MATLAB` facilitate interoperability with other specifications (viz. NeuroML, SBML), simulators (viz NEURON, Brian, NEST), and web-based applications (viz. Geppetto). `xolotl` is freely available at https://github.com/sg-s/xolotl. This tool provides rapid implementation and fast simulation of neuronal models while permitting full control over every aspect of the network and integration.
