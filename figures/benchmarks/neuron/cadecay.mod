COMMENT
Compute the relative Ca shell size between Davison (Bhalla and Bower) and
Liu et al. 1998. From the way that Davison et al. calculate B there in

cai'=B * ica - (cai-cainf)/tau

there is an implicit factor of tau e.g.

B= b_D/tau_D = -5.18e-2

In Davison tau = tau_D (_D to keep straight from Liu et al.)=10
In Liu et al. tau_L=20 and B = B_L=b_L/tau_L=-.94/20=-4.7e-2

Therefore the b_'s are
b_D=-.518
b_L=-.94

since b=-(1e4)/(2*FARADAY*depth) i.e. inversely proportional to depth

b_L/b_D = -.94/-.518 = 1.8146718
depth_D/depth_L = 1.8147
depth_L/depth_D = .55

Davison sets depth to 1 um which implies the Liu et al. depth is
0.55 um.

COMMENT
A note on units: The term in the last equation in the paper on Ca
diffusion (rearranged to include the time const. as implemented here):

-0.94 uM ica
----- --
  20  ms

when written in NEURON will need the ica units in NEURON (mA/cm2)
converted to the papers (nA/nF) however

mA  1nA      area_cm2     nA
--  -------  -------- = 1 --
cm2 1e-3 mA  0.628 nF     nF

where area_cm2 is the area of the cell in cm squared and 0.628 nF is
the capacitance of the cell.  So the factor being 1, doesn't need to be
written.  Also note that there is a factor for each term in the
eqn., of (1e-3 mM)/uM converting each term from uM to mM that since is
common also doesn't have to be written.
