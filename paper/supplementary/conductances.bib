  abstract = {Drosophila ether-à-go-go (eag) is the founding member of a large family of voltage-gated K+ channels, the KCNH family, which includes Kv10, 11, and 12. Concurrent binding of calcium/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) to NH2- and COOH-terminal sites inhibits mammalian EAG1 channels at submicromolar Ca2+ concentrations, likely by causing pore constriction. Although the Drosophila EAG channel was believed to be Ca2+-insensitive (Schönherr R, Löber K, Heinemann SH. EMBO J 19: 3263–3271, 2000.), both the NH2- and COOH-terminal sites are conserved. In this study we show that Drosophila EAG is inhibited by high Ca2+ concentrations that are only present at plasma membrane Ca2+ channel microdomains. To test the role of this regulation in vivo, we engineered mutations that block CaM-binding to the major COOH-terminal site of the endogenous eag locus, disrupting Ca2+-dependent inhibition. eag CaMBD mutants have reduced evoked release from larval motor neuron presynaptic terminals and show decreased Ca2+ influx in stimulated adult projection neuron presynaptic terminals, consistent with an increase in K+ conductance. These results are predicted by a conductance-based multicompartment model of the presynaptic terminal in which some fraction of EAG is localized to the Ca2+ channel microdomains that control neurotransmitter release. The reduction of release in the larval neuromuscular junction drives a compensatory increase in motor neuron somatic excitability. This misregulation of synaptic and somatic excitability has consequences for systems-level processes and leads to defects in associative memory formation in adults.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Regulation of excitability is critical to tuning the nervous system for complex behaviors. We demonstrate in this article that the EAG family of voltage-gated K+ channels exhibit conserved gating by Ca2+/CaM. Disruption of this inhibition in Drosophila results in decreased evoked neurotransmitter release due to truncated Ca2+ influx in presynaptic terminals. In adults, disrupted Ca2+ dynamics cripples memory formation. These data demonstrate that the biophysical details of channels have important implications for cell function and behavior.},

  abstract = {We describe a new technique to fit conductance-based neuron models to intracellular voltage traces from isolated biological neurons. The biological neurons are recorded in current-clamp with pink (1/f) noise injected to perturb the activity of the neuron. The new algorithm finds a set of parameters that allows a multicompartmental model neuron to match the recorded voltage trace. Attempting to match a recorded voltage trace directly has a well-known problem: mismatch in the timing of action potentials between biological and model neuron is inevitable and results in poor phenomenological match between the model and data. Our approach avoids this by applying a weak control adjustment to the model to promote alignment during the fitting procedure. This approach is closely related to the control theoretic concept of a Luenberger observer. We tested this approach on synthetic data and on data recorded from an anterior gastric receptor neuron from the stomatogastric ganglion of the crab Cancer borealis. To test the flexibility of this approach, the synthetic data were constructed with conductance models that were different from the ones used in the fitting model. For both synthetic and biological data, the resultant models had good spike-timing accuracy.},

  abstract = {Modulation is essential for adjusting neurons to prevailing conditions and differing demands. Yet understanding how modulators adjust neuronal properties to alter information processing remains unclear, as is the impact of neuromodulation on energy consumption. Here we combine two computational models, one Hodgkin-Huxley type and the other analytic, to investigate the effects of neuromodulation upon Drosophila melanogaster photoreceptors. Voltage-dependent K+ conductances: (i) activate upon depolarisation to reduce membrane resistance and adjust bandwidth to functional requirements; (ii) produce negative feedback to increase bandwidth in an energy efficient way; (iii) produce shunt-peaking thereby increasing the membrane gain bandwidth product; and (iv) inactivate to amplify low frequencies. Through their effects on the voltage-dependent K+ conductances, three modulators, serotonin, calmodulin and PIP2, trade-off voltage-contrast gain against membrane bandwidth. Serotonin shifts the photoreceptor performance towards higher voltage-contrast gains and lower membrane bandwidths, whereas PIP2 and calmodulin shifts performance towards lower voltage-contrast gains and higher membrane bandwidths. These neuromodulators have little effect upon the overall energy consumed by photoreceptors, instead they redistribute the energy invested in gain versus bandwidth. This demonstrates how modulators can shift neuronal information processing within the limitations of biophysics and energy consumption.},

  abstract = {The electrical characteristics of many neurons are remarkably robust in the face of changing internal and external conditions. At the same time, neurons can be highly sensitive to neuromodulators. We find correlates of this dual robustness and sensitivity in a global analysis of the structure of a conductance-based model neuron. We vary the maximal conductance parameters of the model neuron and, for each set of parameters tested, characterize the activity pattern generated by the cell as silent, tonically firing, or bursting. Within the parameter space of the five maximal conductances of the model, we find directions, representing concerted changes in multiple conductances, along which the basic pattern of neural activity does not change. In other directions, relatively small concurrent changes in a few conductances can induce transitions between these activity patterns. The global structure of the conductance-space maps implies that neuromodulators that alter a sensitive set of conductances will have powerful, and possibly state-dependent, effects. Other modulators that may have no direct impact on the activity of the neuron may nevertheless change the effects of such direct modulators via this state dependence. Some of the results and predictions arising from the model studies are replicated and verified in recordings of stomatogastric ganglion neurons using the dynamic clamp.},

The results are presented in the context of half-center oscillators, which are simple rhythmic circuits composed of two reciprocally connected inhibitory neuronal populations. Specifically, we focus on rhythms that rely on a particular excitability property, the postinhibitory rebound, an intrinsic cellular property that elicits transient membrane depolarization when released from hyperpolarization. Two distinct ionic currents can evoke this transient depolarization: a hyperpolarization-activated cation current and a low-threshold T-type calcium current. The presence of a slow activation is specific to the T-type calcium current and provides a slow positive feedback at the cellular level that is absent in the cation current. We show that this slow positive feedback is required to endow the network rhythm with physiological modulation and robustness properties. This study thereby identifies an essential cellular property to be retained at the network level in modeling network robustness and modulation.},

  abstract = {Neurons in cold-blooded animals remarkably maintain their function over a wide range of temperatures, even though the rates of many cellular processes increase twofold, threefold, or many-fold for each 10°C increase in temperature. Moreover, the kinetics of ion channels, maximal conductances, and \emph{Ca}\textsuperscript{2+} buffering each have independent temperature sensitivities, suggesting that the balance of biological parameters can be disturbed by even modest temperature changes. In stomatogastric ganglia of the crab \emph{Cancer borealis}, the duty cycle of the bursting pacemaker kernel is highly robust between 7 and 23°C (Rinberg et al., 2013). We examined how this might be achieved in a detailed conductance-based model in which exponential temperature sensitivities were given by \emph{Q}\textsubscript{10} parameters. We assessed the temperature robustness of this model across 125,000 random sets of \emph{Q}\textsubscript{10} parameters. To examine how robustness might be achieved across a variable population of animals, we repeated this analysis across six sets of maximal conductance parameters that produced similar activity at 11°C. Many permissible combinations of maximal conductance and \emph{Q}\textsubscript{10} parameters were found over broad regions of parameter space and relatively few correlations among \emph{Q}\textsubscript{10}s were observed across successful parameter sets. A significant portion of \emph{Q}\textsubscript{10} sets worked for at least 3 of the 6 maximal conductance sets (∼11.1\%). Nonetheless, no \emph{Q}\textsubscript{10} set produced robust function across all six maximal conductance sets, suggesting that maximal conductance parameters critically contribute to temperature robustness. Overall, these results provide insight into principles of temperature robustness in neuronal oscillators. $<$/p$>$},

  abstract = {Activity of voltage-gated Na channels (Nav) is modified by alternative splicing. However, whether altered splicing of human Navs contributes to epilepsy remains to be conclusively shown. We show here that altered splicing of the Drosophila Nav (paralytic, DmNav) contributes to seizure-like behavior in identified seizure mutants. We focus attention on a pair of mutually exclusive alternate exons (termed K and L), which form part of the voltage sensor (S4) in domain III of the expressed channel. The presence of exon L results in a large, non-inactivating, persistent INap. Many forms of human epilepsy are associated with an increase in this current. In wild-type (WT) Drosophila larvae, ∼70–80\% of DmNav transcripts contain exon L, and the remainder contain exon K. Splicing of DmNav to include exon L is increased to ∼100\% in both the slamdance and easily-shocked seizure mutants. This change to splicing is prevented by reducing synaptic activity levels through exposure to the antiepileptic phenytoin or the inhibitory transmitter GABA. Conversely, enhancing synaptic activity in WT, by feeding of picrotoxin is sufficient to increase INap and promote seizure through increased inclusion of exon L to 100\%. We also show that the underlying activity-dependent mechanism requires the presence of Pasilla, an RNA-binding protein. Finally, we use computational modeling to show that increasing INap is sufficient to potentiate membrane excitability consistent with a seizure phenotype. Thus, increased synaptic excitation favors inclusion of exon L, which, in turn, further increases neuronal excitability. Thus, at least in Drosophila, this self-reinforcing cycle may promote the incidence of seizure.},

  abstract = {Membrane channels are subject to a wide variety of regulatory mechanisms that can be affected by activity. We present a model of a stomatogastric ganglion (STG) neuron in which several Ca\textsuperscript{2+}-dependent pathways are used to regulate the maximal conductances of membrane currents in an activity-dependent manner. Unlike previous models of this type, the regulation and modification of maximal conductances by electrical activity is unconstrained. The model has seven voltage-dependent membrane currents and uses three Ca\textsuperscript{2+} sensors acting on different time scales. Starting from random initial conditions over a given range, the model sets the maximal conductances for its active membrane currents to values that produce a predefined target pattern of activity ∼90\% of the time. In these models, the same pattern of electrical activity can be produced by a range of maximal conductances, and this range is compared with voltage-clamp data from the lateral pyloric neuron of the STG. If the electrical activity of the model neuron is perturbed, the maximal conductances adjust to restore the original pattern of activity. When the perturbation is removed, the activity pattern is again restored after a transient adjustment period, but the conductances may not return to their initial values. The model suggests that neurons may regulate their conductances to maintain fixed patterns of electrical activity, rather than fixed maximal conductances, and that the regulation process requires feedback systems capable of reacting to changes of electrical activity on a number of different time scales.$<$/p$>$},

The first population consisted of 1000 model neurons with differing values of seven voltage-dependent conductances. In many of these models, increasing the sodium conductance threefold unexpectedly reduced the firing rate and divisively scaled the gain at high input current. In the second population, consisting of 1000 simplified model neurons, we found that enhanced sodium conductance changed the frequency–current (FI) curve in two computationally distinct ways, depending on the firing rate. In these models, increased sodium conductance produced a subtractive shift in the FI curve at low firing rates because the additional sodium conductance allowed the neuron to respond more strongly to equivalent input current. In contrast, at high input current, the increase in sodium conductance resulted in a divisive change in the gain because the increased conductance produced a proportionally larger activation of the delayed rectifier potassium conductance. The control and sodium-enhanced FI curves intersect at a point that delimits two regions in which the same biophysical manipulation produces two fundamentally different changes to the model neuron's computational properties. This suggests a potentially difficult problem for homeostatic regulation of intrinsic excitability.},

While current density was low, other features of the sodium current in wild-type neurons, including the voltage sensitivity, steady-state inactivation, macroscopic time course, and TTX sensitivity were similar to those found in other excitable cells. Physiological and biochemical evidence has led to the suggestion that mutations in the nap, seizure, and tip-E loci of Drosophila may affect voltage-dependent sodium channels. There was no significant difference in the percentage of neurons expressing sodium currents in cultures prepared from embryos with mutations at the nap, sei or tip-E loci compared with wild-type cultures. Sodium currents recorded from napts appeared similar in all of the properties examined to those in wild-type cells. However, neuronal sodium current density was 40-60\% lower in cultures prepared from both tip-E and seits1 embryos. The voltage dependence and gating properties of these sodium channels, as well as the TTX sensitivity, appear similar to wild type.

  abstract = {Synaptic depression is a form of short-term plasticity exhibited by many synapses. Nonetheless, the functional significance of synaptic depression in oscillatory networks is not well understood. We show that, in a recurrent inhibitory network that includes an intrinsic oscillator, synaptic depression can give rise to two distinct modes of network operation. When the maximal conductance of the depressing synapse is small, the oscillation period is determined by the oscillator component. Increasing the maximal conductance beyond a threshold value activates a positive-feedback mechanism that greatly enhances the synaptic strength. In this mode, the oscillation period is determined by the strength and dynamics of the depressing synapse. Because of the regenerative nature of the feedback mechanism, the circuit can be switched from one mode of operation to another by a very small change in the maximal conductance of the depressing synapse. Our model was inspired by experimental work on the pyloric network of the lobster. The pyloric network produces a simple motor rhythm generated by a pacemaker neuron that receives feedback inhibition from a depressing synapse. In some preparations, elimination of the synapse had no effect on the period of the rhythm, whereas in other preparations, there was a significant decrease in the period. We propose that the pyloric network can operate in either of the two modes suggested by the model, depending on the maximal conductance of the depressing synapse.},

The stomatogastric nervous system of the crab Cancer borealis produces a rapid pyloric rhythm and a considerably slower gastric mill rhythm. We construct and analyze a conductance-based compartmental model to explore the activation of the gastric mill rhythm by the modulatory commissural neuron 1 (MCN1). This model demonstrates that the period of the MCN1-activated gastric mill rhythm, which was thought to be determined entirely by the interaction of neurons in the gastric mill network, can be strongly influenced by inhibitory synaptic input from the pacemaker neuron of the fast pyloric rhythm, the anterior burster (AB) neuron. Surprisingly, the change of the gastric mill period produced by the pyloric input to the gastric mill system can be many times larger than the period of the pyloric rhythm itself. This model illustrates several mechanisms by which a fast oscillatory neuron may control the frequency of a much slower oscillatory network. These findings suggest that it is possible to modify the slow rhythm either by direct modulation or indirectly by modulating the faster rhythm.},

  abstract = {Insects are favoured objects for studying information processing in restricted neuronal networks, e.g. motor pattern generation or sensory perception. The analysis of the underlying processes requires knowledge of the electrical properties of the cells involved. These properties are determined by the expression pattern of ionic channels and by the regulation of their function, e.g. by neuromodulators. We here review the presently available knowledge on insect non-synaptic ion channels and ionic currents in neurons and skeletal muscles. The first part of this article covers genetic and structural informations, the localization of channels, their electrophysiological and pharmacological properties, and known effects of second messengers and modulators such as neuropeptides or biogenic amines. In a second part we describe in detail modulation of ionic currents in three particularly well investigated preparations, i.e. Drosophila photoreceptor, cockroach DUM (dorsal unpaired median) neuron and locust jumping muscle. Ion channel structures are almost exclusively known for the fruitfly Drosophila, and most of the information on their function has also been obtained in this animal, mainly based on mutational analysis and investigation of heterologously expressed channels. Now the entire genome of Drosophila has been sequenced, it seems almost completely known which types of channel genes — and how many of them — exist in this animal. There is much knowledge of the various types of channels formed by 6-transmembrane — spanning segments (6TM channels) including those where four 6TM domains are joined within one large protein (e.g. classical Na+ channel). In comparison, two TM channels and 4TM (or tandem) channels so far have hardly been explored. There are, however, various well characterized ionic conductances, e.g. for Ca2+, Cl− or K+, in other insect preparations for which the channels are not yet known. In some of the larger insects, i.e. bee, cockroach, locust and moth, rather detailed information has been established on the role of ionic currents in certain physiological or behavioural contexts. On the whole, however, knowledge of non-synaptic ion channels in such insects is still fragmentary. Modulation of ion currents usually involves activation of more or less elaborate signal transduction cascades. The three detailed examples for modulation presented in the second part indicate, amongst other things, that one type of modulator usually leads to concerted changes of several ion currents and that the effects of different modulators in one type of cell may overlap. Modulators participate in the adaptive changes of the various cells responsible for different physiological or behavioural states. Further study of their effects on the single cell level should help to understand how small sets of cells cooperate in order to produce the appropriate output.},

  abstract = {We study the electrical activity patterns and the expression of conductances in adult stomatogastric ganglion (STG) neurons as a function of time in primary cell culture. When first plated in culture, these neurons had few active properties. After 1 d in culture they produced small action potentials that rapidly inactivated during maintained depolarization. After 2 d in culture they fired large action potentials tonically when depolarized, and their properties resembled very closely the properties of STG neurons pharmacologically isolated in the ganglion. After 3-4 d in culture, however, their electrical properties changed and they fired in bursts when depolarized. We characterized the currents expressed by these neurons in culture. They included two TTX-sensitive sodium currents, a calcium current, a delayed-rectifier-like current, a calcium-dependent potassium current, and two A-type currents. The changes in firing properties with time in culture were accompanied by an increase in inward and decrease in outward current densities. A single-compartment conductance-based model of an STG neuron was constructed by fitting the currents measured in the biological neurons. When the current densities in the model neuron were matched to those measured for the biological neurons in each activity state, the model neuron closely reproduced each state, indicating that the changes in current densities are sufficient to account for the changes in intrinsic properties. These data indicate that STG neurons isolated in culture change their intrinsic electrical properties by selectively adjusting the magnitudes of their ionic conductances.},

  abstract = {Electrical coupling between neurons with similar properties is often studied. Nonetheless, the role of electrical coupling between neurons with widely different intrinsic properties also occurs, but is less well understood. Inspired by the pacemaker group of the crustacean pyloric network, we developed a multicompartment, conductance-based model of a small network of intrinsically distinct, electrically coupled neurons. In the pyloric network, a small intrinsically bursting neuron, through gap junctions, drives 2 larger, tonically spiking neurons to reliably burst in-phase with it. Each model neuron has 2 compartments, one responsible for spike generation and the other for producing a slow, large-amplitude oscillation. We illustrate how these compartments interact and determine the dynamics of the model neurons. Our model captures the dynamic oscillation range measured from the isolated and coupled biological neurons. At the network level, we explore the range of coupling strengths for which synchronous bursting oscillations are possible. The spatial segregation of ionic currents significantly enhances the ability of the 2 neurons to burst synchronously, and the oscillation range of the model pacemaker network depends not only on the strength of the electrical synapse but also on the identity of the neuron receiving inputs. We also compare the activity of the electrically coupled, distinct neurons with that of a network of coupled identical bursting neurons. For small to moderate coupling strengths, the network of identical elements, when receiving asymmetrical inputs, can have a smaller dynamic range of oscillation than that of its constituent neurons in isolation.},

We propose a model in which the strengths of inhibitory synapses in a central pattern-generating circuit are subject to activity-dependent plasticity. The strength of each synapse is modified as a function of the global activity of the postsynaptic neuron and by correlated activity of the pre- and postsynaptic neurons. This allows the self-assembly, from random initial synaptic strengths, of two cells into reciprocal oscillation and three cells into a rhythmic triphasic motor pattern. This self-assembly illustrates that complex oscillatory circuits that depend on multiple inhibitory synaptic connections can be tuned via simple activity-dependent rules.},

To demonstrate an artificial voltage-dependent conductance, we simulate the action of a voltage-dependent proctolin response on a neuron in the intact stomatogastric ganglion. We show that shifts in the activation curve and the maximal conductance of the response produce different effects on the target neuron. 4. The dynamic clamp is used to construct reciprocal inhibitory synapses between two stomatogastric ganglion neurons that are not coupled naturally, illustrating that this method can be used to form new networks at will.},

  abstract = {Six neuromodulators [proctolin, Cancer borealis tachykinin-related peptide Ia, crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP), red pigment-concentrating hormone, TNRNFLRFamide, and pilocarpine] converge onto the same voltage-dependent inward current in stomatogastric ganglion (STG) neurons of the crab C. borealis. We show here that each of these modulators acts on a distinct subset of pyloric network neurons in the STG. To ask whether the differences in cell targets could account for their differential effects on the pyloric rhythm, we systematically compared the motor patterns produced by proctolin and CCAP. The motor patterns produced in proctolin and CCAP differed quantitatively in a number of ways. Proctolin and CCAP both act on the lateral pyloric neuron and the inferior cardiac neuron. Proctolin additionally acts on the pyloric dilator (PD) neurons, the pyloric (PY) neurons, and the ventricular dilator neuron. Using the dynamic clamp, we introduced an artificial peptide-elicited current into the PD and PY neurons, in the presence of CCAP, and converted the CCAP rhythm into a rhythm that was statistically similar to that seen in proctolin. This suggests that the differences in the network effects of these two modulators can primarily be attributed to the known differential distributions of their receptors onto distinct subsets of neurons, despite the fact that they activate the same current.},

  abstract = {Different modulatory inputs commonly elicit distinct rhythmic motor patterns from a central pattern generator (CPG), but they can instead elicit the same pattern. We are determining the rhythm-generating mechanisms in this latter situation, using the gastric mill (chewing) CPG in the crab (Cancer borealis) stomatogastric ganglion, where stimulating the projection neuron MCN1 (modulatory commissural neuron 1) or bath applying CabPK (C. borealis pyrokinin) peptide elicits the same gastric mill motor pattern, despite configuring different gastric mill circuits. In both cases, the core rhythm generator includes the same reciprocally inhibitory neurons LG (lateral gastric) and Int1 (interneuron 1), but the pyloric (food-filtering) circuit pacemaker neuron AB (anterior burster) is additionally necessary only for CabPK rhythm generation. MCN1 drives this rhythm generator by activating in the LG neuron the modulator-activated inward current (IMI), which waxes and wanes periodically due to phasic feedback inhibition of MCN1 transmitter release. Each buildup of IMI enables the LG neuron to generate a self-terminating burst and thereby alternate with Int1 activity. Here we establish that CabPK drives gastric mill rhythm generation by activating in the LG neuron IMI plus a slowly activating transient, low-threshold inward current (ITrans-LTS) that is voltage, time, and Ca(2+) dependent. Unlike MCN1, CabPK maintains a steady IMI activation, causing a subthreshold depolarization in LG that facilitates a periodic postinhibitory rebound burst caused by the regular buildup and decay of the availability of ITrans-LTS. Thus, different modulatory inputs can use different rhythm-generating mechanisms to drive the same neuronal rhythm. Additionally, the same ionic current (IMI) can play different roles under these different conditions, while different currents (IMI, ITrans-LTS) can play the same role.},

  abstract = {Conventionally, the parameters of neuronal models are hand-tuned using trial-and-error searches to produce a desired behavior. Here, we present an alternative approach. We have generated a database of about 1.7 million single-compartment model neurons by independently varying 8 maximal membrane conductances based on measurements from lobster stomatogastric neurons. We classified the spontaneous electrical activity of each model neuron and its responsiveness to inputs during runtime with an adaptive algorithm and saved a reduced version of each neuron's activity pattern. Our analysis of the distribution of different activity types (silent, spiking, bursting, irregular) in the 8-dimensional conductance space indicates that the coarse grid of conductance values we chose is sufficient to capture the salient features of the distribution. The database can be searched for different combinations of neuron properties such as activity type, spike or burst frequency, resting potential, frequency-current relation, and phase-response curve. We demonstrate how the database can be screened for models that reproduce the behavior of a specific biological neuron and show that the contents of the database can give insight into the way a neuron's membrane conductances determine its activity pattern and response properties. Similar databases can be constructed to explore parameter spaces in multicompartmental models or small networks, or to examine the effects of changes in the voltage dependence of currents. In all cases, database searches can provide insight into how neuronal and network properties depend on the values of the parameters in the models.},
