  abstract = {AbstractStudies of the stomatogastric nervous systems of lobsters and crabs have led to numerous insights into the cellular and circuit mechanisms that generate rhythmic motor patterns. The small number of easily identifiable neurons allowed the establishment of connectivity diagrams among the neurons of the stomatogastric ganglion. We now know that (a) neuromodulatory substances reconfigure circuit dynamics by altering synaptic strength and voltage-dependent conductances and (b) individual neurons can switch among different functional circuits. Computational and experimental studies of single-neuron and network homeostatic regulation have provided insight into compensatory mechanisms that can underlie stable network performance. Many of the observations first made using the stomatogastric nervous system can be generalized to other invertebrate and vertebrate circuits.},

  abstract = {We study the electrical activity patterns and the expression of conductances in adult stomatogastric ganglion (STG) neurons as a function of time in primary cell culture. When first plated in culture, these neurons had few active properties. After 1 d in culture they produced small action potentials that rapidly inactivated during maintained depolarization. After 2 d in culture they fired large action potentials tonically when depolarized, and their properties resembled very closely the properties of STG neurons pharmacologically isolated in the ganglion. After 3-4 d in culture, however, their electrical properties changed and they fired in bursts when depolarized. We characterized the currents expressed by these neurons in culture. They included two TTX-sensitive sodium currents, a calcium current, a delayed-rectifier-like current, a calcium-dependent potassium current, and two A-type currents. The changes in firing properties with time in culture were accompanied by an increase in inward and decrease in outward current densities. A single-compartment conductance-based model of an STG neuron was constructed by fitting the currents measured in the biological neurons. When the current densities in the model neuron were matched to those measured for the biological neurons in each activity state, the model neuron closely reproduced each state, indicating that the changes in current densities are sufficient to account for the changes in intrinsic properties. These data indicate that STG neurons isolated in culture change their intrinsic electrical properties by selectively adjusting the magnitudes of their ionic conductances.},

  abstract = {Robustness, the insensitivity of some of a biological system's functionalities to a set of distinct conditions, is intimately linked to fitness. Recent studies suggest that it may also play a vital role in enabling the evolution of species. Increasing robustness, so is proposed, can lead to the emergence of evolvability if evolution proceeds over a neutral network that extends far throughout the fitness landscape. Here, we show that the design principles used to achieve robustness dramatically influence whether robustness leads to evolvability. In simulation experiments, we find that purely redundant systems have remarkably low evolvability while degenerate, i.e. partially redundant, systems tend to be orders of magnitude more evolvable. Surprisingly, the magnitude of observed variation in evolvability can neither be explained by differences in the size nor the topology of the neutral networks. This suggests that degeneracy, a ubiquitous characteristic in biological systems, may be an important enabler of natural evolution. More generally, our study provides valuable new clues about the origin of innovations in complex adaptive systems.},

$<$li$><$p$>$Robustness is a ubiquitous feature of biological systems. It ensures that specific functions of the system are maintained despite external and internal perturbations. System control, alternative (or fail-safe) mechanisms, modularity and decoupling are the underlying mechanisms that produce robustness.$<$/p$><$/li$>$
$<$li$><$p$>$Robustness facilitates the evolvability of complex dynamic systems. Evolution, given enough time, might select a robust trait that is tolerant against environmental perturbations. This interlinks the properties of robustness and evolvability. Robustness is ubiquitous in biological systems that have evolved.$<$/p$><$/li$>$
$<$li$><$p$>$There are specific architectural requirements for robust and evolvable systems — genetic buffering, robust modules and bow-tie architecture. These architectural requirements are the basis for the system's robustness against environmental perturbations, but congruent with genetic perturbations; they facilitate generation of a flexible phenotype.$<$/p$><$/li$>$
$<$li$><$p$>$Systems that are robust involve intrinsic trade-offs. Enhanced robustness against certain perturbations has to be balanced by extreme fragility elsewhere. This robust yet fragile nature, predicted by the highly optimized tolerance (HOT) theory, is a fundamental property of the system that has been optimally designed or has evolved to cope with perturbations. There are also other trade-offs in the system's performance and resource demands.$<$/p$><$/li$>$
$<$li$><$p$>$Diseases can be thought of in terms of the exposed fragility of robust yet fragile systems. The design of effective countermeasures requires proper understanding of a system's behavioural and failure patterns. \emph{Diabetes mellitus}, cancer and HIV infection represent the typical failure of such a system that requires systematic countermeasures to control robustness of an epidemic state. Countermeasures include systematic intervention to control a system's dynamics, attack fragility or introduce decoys to re-establish control.$<$/p$><$/li$>$
$<$li$><$p$>$Developing a theory of biological robustness with a solid mathematical foundation that can realistically represent biological systems is a difficult challenge. Research into non-linear dynamics, control theory and non-equilibrium theory is urgently required, but it has to be careful to capture the essential structural complexity and heterogeneity of biological systems.$<$/p$><$/li$><$/ul$><$/p$>$},

To determine how tightly neuronal properties and synaptic strengths need to be tuned to produce a given network output, we simulated more than 20 million versions of a three-cell model of the pyloric network of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion using different combinations of synapse strengths and neuron properties. We found that virtually indistinguishable network activity can arise from widely disparate sets of underlying mechanisms, suggesting that there could be considerable animal-to-animal variability in many of the parameters that control network activity, and that many different combinations of synaptic strengths and intrinsic membrane properties can be consistent with appropriate network performance.},

The paper proposes that this question can be addressed through the analysis of dynamic input conductances. Those voltage-dependent curves aggregate the concomitant activity of all ion channels in distinct timescales. They are shown to shape the current−voltage dynamical relationships that determine neuronal spiking. We propose an experimental protocol to measure dynamic input conductances in neurons. In addition, we provide a computational method to extract dynamic input conductances from arbitrary conductance-based models and to analyze their sensitivity to arbitrary parameters. We illustrate the relevance of the proposed approach for modulation, compensation, and robustness studies in a published neuron model based on data of the stomatogastric ganglion of the crab Cancer borealis.},

The value of this important parameter remains controversial. In this study, Cm was estimated for the somatic membrane of cortical pyramidal neurons, spinal cord neurons, and hippocampal neurons. A nucleated patch was pulled and a voltage-clamp step was applied. The exponential decay of the capacitative charging current was analyzed to give the total membrane capacitance, which was then divided by the observed surface area of the patch. Cm was 0.9μF/cm2 for each class of neuron. To test the possibility that membrane proteins may alter Cm, embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) were studied before and after transfection with a plasmid coding for glycine receptor/channels. The value of Cm was indistinguishable in untransfected cells and in transfected cells expressing a high level of glycine channels, indicating that differences in transmembrane protein content do not significantly affect Cm. Thus, to a first approximation, Cm may be treated as a “biological constant” across many classes of neuron.},

Anatomical studies of single pyloric network neurons and of the whole stomatogastric ganglion (STG) showed that the STG and its neurons grow considerably from juvenile to adult. Despite these changes in size, intracellularly recorded membrane potential waveforms of pyloric network neurons and the phase relationships in the pyloric rhythm were very similar between juvenile and adult preparations. Across adult preparations, the cycle period and number of spikes per burst were not tightly maintained, but the mean phase relationships were independent of the period of the rhythm and relatively tightly maintained across preparations.

We also saw two- to fourfold interanimal variability for three potassium currents and their mRNA expression. Measurements of channel expression in the two electrically coupled pyloric dilator (PD) neurons showed significant interanimal variability, but copy numbers for IH (encoding the hyperpolarization-activated, inward-current channel) and Shal mRNA in the two PD neurons from the same crab were similar, suggesting that the regulation of some currents may be shared in electrically coupled neurons.},

The dynamic-clamp (also called "conductance injection") allows experimentalists and theoreticians to challenge neurons (or any other type of cell) with complex conductance stimuli generated by a computer.  The technique can be implemented from neural simulation environments and a variety of custom-made or commercial systems. The real-time interaction between the computer and cell also enables the design of recording paradigms with unprecedented accuracy via a computational model of the electrode. Dynamic-Clamp: From Principles to Applications contains contributions from leading researchers in the field, who investigate these paradigms at the cellular or network level, in vivo and in vitro, and in different brain regions and cardiac cells. Topics discussed include the addition of artificially-generated synaptic activity to neurons; adding, amplifying or neutralizing voltage-dependent conductances; creating hybrid networks with real and artificial cells; attaching simulated dendritic tree structures to the living cell; and connecting different neurons.   This book will be of interest to experimental biophysicists, neurophysiologists, and cardiac physiologists, as well as theoreticians, engineers, and computational neuroscientists. Graduate and undergraduate students will also find up-to-date coverage of physiological problems and how they are investigated.

Regulated model neurons maintain a constant average level of activity over a wide range of conditions by appropriately adjusting their conductances. The intracellular calcium concentration acts as a feedback element linking maximal conductances to electrical activity. The resulting plasticity of intrinsic characteristics has important implications for network behavior. We first study a simple two-conductance model, then introduce techniques that allow us to analyze dynamic regulation with an arbitrary number of conductances, and finally illustrate this method by studying a seven-conductance model. We conclude with an analysis of spontaneous differentiation of identical model neurons in a two-cell network.},

  abstract = {For decades, the episodic gastric rhythm of the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system (STNS) has served as an important model system for understanding the generation of rhythmic motor behaviors. Here we quantitatively describe many features of the gastric rhythm of the crab Cancer borealis under several conditions. First, we analyzed spontaneous gastric rhythms produced by freshly dissected preparations of the STNS, including the cycle frequency and phase relationships among gastric units. We find that phase is relatively conserved across frequency, similar to the pyloric rhythm. We also describe relationships between these two rhythms, including a significant gastric/pyloric frequency correlation. We then performed continuous, days-long extracellular recordings of gastric activity from preparations of the STNS in which neuromodulatory inputs to the stomatogastric ganglion were left intact and also from preparations in which these modulatory inputs were cut (decentralization). This allowed us to provide quantitative descriptions of variability and phase conservation within preparations across time. For intact preparations, gastric activity was more variable than pyloric activity but remained relatively stable across 4–6 days, and many significant correlations were found between phase and frequency within animals. Decentralized preparations displayed fewer episodes of gastric activity, with altered phase relationships, lower frequencies, and reduced coordination both among gastric units and between the gastric and pyloric rhythms. Together, these results provide insight into the role of neuromodulation in episodic pattern generation and the extent of animal-to-animal variability in features of spontaneously occurring gastric rhythms.},

Previous work, done in the presence of descending modulatory inputs, had shown that the pyloric rhythm of the crab increases in frequency as temperature increases, but maintains its characteristic phase relationships until it 'crashes' at extreme high temperatures. To study the interaction between neuromodulators and temperature perturbations, we studied the effects of temperature on preparations from which the descending modulatory inputs were removed. Under these conditions the pyloric rhythm was destabilized. We then studied the effects of temperature on preparations in the presence of oxotremorine, proctolin, and serotonin. Oxotremorine and proctolin enhanced the robustness of the pyloric rhythm, while serotonin made the rhythm less robust. These experiments reveal considerable animal-to-animal diversity in their crash stability, consistent with the interpretation that cryptic differences in many cell and network parameters are revealed by extreme perturbations.},

  issn = {0270-6474},
  abstract = {The modulation of the pyloric network of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the lobster Panulirus interruptus by the neuropeptide proctolin is described. First, the effects of proctolin on the pyloric motor patterns were characterized in terms of frequency and phase relations. Pyloric cycle frequency and lateral pyloric (LP) neuron activity increased and ventricular dilator (VD) neuron activity decreased with increasing concentrations (10(-9)-10(-6) M) of applied proctolin. Next, the effects of proctolin on the individual neurons that constitute the pyloric network were determined. Identified neurons were isolated from chemical and electrical presynaptic inputs by using pharmacological agents (Marder and Eisen, 1984a) and/or photoinactivation following Lucifer yellow injection (Miller and Selverston, 1979). Proctolin increased the amplitude and frequency of bursts produced by isolated pacemaker anterior burster (AB) neurons. Isolated LP and pyloric (PY) neurons responded to proctolin with increases in activity only when they were at or above threshold. All other pyloric neurons were unaffected. To determine how the direct effects of proctolin on isolated neurons resulted in the observed changes in frequency and phase relations in the motor pattern of the intact pyloric circuit seen in proctolin, individual neurons were deleted from the circuit. A comparison of proctolin's effects on isolated neurons with those on the intact network shows that the synaptic connectivity among neurons directly affected by proctolin and those unaffected by it shapes the network's response to proctolin.},

  abstract = {1. Results from the companion paper were incorporated into a physiologically realistic computer model of the three principal cell types (PD/AB, LP, PY) of the pyloric network in the stomatogastric ganglion. Parameters for the model were mostly calculated (sometimes estimated) from experimental data rather than fitting the model to observed output patterns. 2. The initial run was successful in predicting several features of the pyloric pattern: the observed gap between PD and LP bursts, the appropriate sequence of the activity periods (PD, LP, PY), and a substantial PY burst not properly simulated by an earlier model. 3. The major discrepancy between model and observed patterns was the too-early occurrence of the PY burst, which resulted in a much shortened LP burst. Motivated by this discrepancy, additional investigations were made of PY properties. A hyperpolarization-enabled depolorization-activated hyperpolarizing conductance change was discovered which may make an important contribution to the late phase of PY activity in the normal burst cycle. Addition of this effect to the model brought its predictions more in line with observed patterns. 4. Other discrepancies between model and observation were instructive and are discussed. The findings force a substantial revision in previously held ideas on pattern production in the pyloric system. More weight must be given to functional properties of individual neurons and less to properties arising purely from network interactions. This shift in emphasis may be necessary in more complicated systems as well. 5. An example has been provided of the value quantitative modeling can be to network physiology. Only through rigorous quantitative testing can qualitative theories of how the nervous system operates be substantiated.},

I investigated this issue in thewell-defined, rhythmic pyloric neural network. When pyloric cyclefrequency is altered three- to fivefold, pyloric inter-neuronaldelays shift by hundreds to thousands of msec, and all pyloricpattern elements show strong phase maintenance. The experimentalparadigm used is unlikely to activate exogenous inputs to thenetwork, and these delay changes are thus likely to arise fromphase-compensatory mechanisms intrinsic to the network. Pyloricinter-neuronal delays depend on the time constants of the network‘ssynapses and of the membrane properties of its neurons. The observeddelay shifts thus suggest that, in response to changes in overallcycle frequency, these constants vary so as to maintain patternphasing.},

This change is not only due to the emergence of new powerful tools for the analysis of the brain and its reactions to insults, but it also reflects a conceptual change in the way we approach these problems. As an illustration to this development, it is instructive to go back to the proceedings of a meeting at the NIH in 1955 edited by William F. Windle, which summarizes the disillusioned and pessimistic view on CNS regeneration prevailing at the time. While this generation of researchers were well aware of the issues at stake, they felt they had reached the end of the road; the approaches they had pursued had got stuck and the tools available could not take them any further. I can very well imagine that the participants, most of them leaders in the field, left that conference feeling they had heard their field being sentenced to death.},

Each pattern corresponds to a specific behavioural situation: pattern 1 is only observed in unfed lobsters and feeding invariably produces a switch from pattern 1 to pattern 2 (Fig. 3). 3.The two pyloric patterns differ in the period of the cycle (Fig. 4), the burst duration of the constrictors (Fig. 5), the latency of firing of the constrictors in the cycle (Fig. 6) and the phase of the constrictors in the cycle (Fig. 7). Correlation between period and constrictor latency is weak in pattern 1 and strong in pattern 2 (Fig. 8). 4.The two pyloric patterns can be recorded from in vitro preparations only when the stomatogastric ganglion (i.e. the CPG) is connected to the more rostral commissural ganglia (Fig. 9). 5.At least in pattern 1, cycling of the constrictors can occur when the dilators (known as pacemakers in the CPG) are silent (Fig. 10). 6.For these reasons, we concluded that a commissural oscillator could be participating in the organization of the pyloric output. However, the synaptic relationships which exist between the motor neurones (i.e. the CPG) cannot be neglected (Fig. 11) and this suggests that, in the intact animal, the motor output is organized by the cooperation of a premotor oscillator and a motor oscillator.},

  issn = {0022-3077},
  abstract = {Rhythmic movements of the gastric mill and pyloric regions of the crustacean foregut are controlled by two stomatogastric neuronal networks that have been intensively studied in vitro. By using electromyographic recordings from the European lobster, Homarus gammarus, we have monitored simultaneously the motor activity of pyloric and gastric mill muscles for 300\% of their mean duration. However, the duration of activity in the lateral pyloric constrictor muscle, innervated by the unique lateral pyloric (LP) motor neuron, remains unaffected by this perturbation. During this period after gastric perturbation, LP neuron and PY neurons thus express opposite burst-to-period relationships in that LP neuron burst duration is independent of the ongoing cycle period, whereas PY neuron burst duration changes with period length. In vitro the same type of gastro-pyloric interaction is observed, indicating that it is not dependent on sensory inputs. Moreover, this interaction is intrinsic to the stomatogastric ganglion itself because the relationship between the two networks persists after suppression of descending inputs to the ganglion. Intracellular recordings reveal that this gastro-pyloric interaction originates from the gastric MG and LG neurons of the gastric network, which inhibit the pyloric pacemaker ensemble. As a consequence, the pyloric PY neurons, which are inhibited by the pyloric dilator (PD) neurons of the pyloric pacemaker group, extend their activity during the time that PD neuron is held silent. Moreover, there is evidence for a pyloro-gastric interaction, apparently rectifying, from the pyloric pacemakers back to the gastric MG/LG neuron group.},

  abstract = {Distinct motor patterns are selected from a multifunctional neuronal network by activation of different modulatory projection neurons. Subsets of these projection neurons can contain the same neuromodulator(s), yet little is known about the relative influence of such neurons on network activity. We have addressed this issue in the stomatogastric nervous system of the crab Cancer borealis. Within this system, there is a neuronal network in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) that produces many versions of the pyloric and gastric mill rhythms. These different rhythms result from activation of different projection neurons that innervate the STG from neighboring ganglia and modulate STG network activity. Three pairs of these projection neurons contain the neuropeptide proctolin. These include the previously identified modulatory proctolin neuron and modulatory commissural neuron 1 (MCN1) and the newly identified modulatory commissural neuron 7 (MCN7). We document here that each of these neurons contains a unique complement of cotransmitters and that each of these neurons elicits a distinct version of the pyloric motor pattern. Moreover, only one of them (MCN1) also elicits a gastric mill rhythm. The MCN7-elicited pyloric rhythm includes a pivotal switch by one STG network neuron from playing a minor to a major role in motor pattern generation. Therefore, modulatory neurons that share a peptide transmitter can elicit distinct motor patterns from a common target network.},

  abstract = {The amines dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-HT), and octopamine (Oct) each elicit a distinctive motor pattern from a quiescent pyloric network in the lobster stomatogastric ganglion (STG). We previously have demonstrated that these amines alter the synaptic strength at multiple, distributed sites within the pyloric network that could contribute to the amine-induced motor patterns. Here, we examined the postsynaptic contribution to these changes in synaptic strength by determining how the amines modify responses of pyloric motor neurons to glutamate (Glu), one of the network transmitters, applied iontophoretically into the STG neuropil. Dopamine reduced the Glu responses of the pyloric dilator (PD), ventricular dilator (VD), and inferior cardiac (IC) neurons and enhanced the Glu responses of the lateral pyloric (LP) and pyloric constrictor (PY) neurons. The only effect of 5-HT was to reduce the Glu response of the VD neuron. Oct enhanced the Glu responses of the LP and PY neurons but did not affect the PD, VD, and IC responses. We also examined amine effects on the depolarizing responses to iontophoresed acetylcholine (ACh) in the PD and VD and found that they paralleled the amine effects on Glu responses in these neurons. This suggests that amine modulation of PD and VD responses to Glu and ACh may be explained by general changes in the ionic conductance of these neurons. We compare our results with our earlier work describing amine effects on synaptic strength and input resistance to show that amines act at both pre- and postsynaptic sites to modify graded synaptic transmission in the pyloric network.},

Specifically, we investigated decentralization-induced changes in the distribution and density of the transient outward current,I A, which is encoded within the STG by the shal gene and plays an important role in shaping rhythmic bursting of pyloric neurons. Using an antibody against lobster shal K+ channels, we found shal immunoreactivity in the membranes of neuritic processes, but not somata, of STG neurons in 5 d cultured STNS with intact modulatory inputs. However, in 5 d decentralized STG, shal immunoreactivity was still seen in primary neurites but was likewise present in a subset of STG somata. Among the neurons displaying this altered shal localization was the pyloric dilator (PD) neuron, which remained rhythmically active in 5 d decentralized STG. Two-electrode voltage clamp was used to compare I A in synaptically isolated PD neurons in long-term decentralized STG and nondecentralized controls. Although the voltage dependence and kinetics ofI A changed little with decentralization, the maximal conductance of I A in PD neurons increased by 43.4\%. This increase was consistent with the decentralization-induced increase in shal protein expression, indicating an alteration in the density and distribution of functional A-channels. Our results suggest that, in addition to the short-term regulation of network function, modulatory inputs may also play a role, either directly or indirectly, in controlling channel number and distribution, thereby maintaining the biophysical character of neuronal targets on a long-term basis.},

The solutions resembled the morphology of real neurons. In particular the neurons optimized for linear summation electrotonically separated their synapses, as found in avian nucleus laminaris neurons, and neurons optimized for spike-order detection had primary dendrites of significantly different diameter, as found in the basal and apical dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons. This similarity makes an experimentally testable prediction of our theoretical approach, which is that pyramidal neurons can act as spike-order detectors for basal and apical inputs.

Nevertheless, no formalism has yet been described which can capture the general features of neuronal branching. Here we propose such a formalism, which is derived from the expression of dendritic arborizations as locally optimized graphs. Inspired by Ramón y Cajal's laws of conservation of cytoplasm and conduction time in neural circuitry, we show that this graphical representation can be used to optimize these variables. This approach allows us to generate synthetic branching geometries which replicate morphological features of any tested neuron. The essential structure of a neuronal tree is thereby captured by the density profile of its spanning field and by a single parameter, a balancing factor weighing the costs for material and conduction time. This balancing factor determines a neuron's electrotonic compartmentalization. Additions to this rule, when required in the construction process, can be directly attributed to developmental processes or a neuron's computational role within its neural circuit. The simulations presented here are implemented in an open-source software package, the "TREES toolbox," which provides a general set of tools for analyzing, manipulating, and generating dendritic structure, including a tool to create synthetic members of any particular cell group and an approach for a model-based supervised automatic morphological reconstruction from fluorescent image stacks. These approaches provide new insights into the constraints governing dendritic architectures. They also provide a novel framework for modelling and analyzing neuronal branching structures and for constructing realistic synthetic neural networks.},

  abstract = {Neocortical neurons display a wide range of dendritic morphologies, ranging from compact arborizations to highly elaborate branching patterns. In vitro electrical recordings from these neurons have revealed a correspondingly diverse range of intrinsic firing patterns, including non-adapting, adapting and bursting types. This heterogeneity of electrical responsivity has generally been attributed to variability in the types and densities of ionic channels. We show here, using compartmental models of reconstructed cortical neurons, that an entire spectrum of firing patterns can be reproduced in a set of neurons that share a common distribution of ion channels and differ only in their dendritic geometry. The essential behaviour of the model depends on partial electrical coupling of fast active conductances localized to the soma and axon and slow active currents located throughout the dendrites, and can be reproduced in a two-compartment model. The results suggest a causal relationship for the observed correlations between dendritic structure and firing properties and emphasize the importance of active dendritic conductances in neuronal function.},

To determine whether the changes in the currents are sufficient to produce the change in action potential duration and ionic dependence, we constructed a Hodgkin-Huxley model of electrical excitability of these neurons. The model shows that the equations describing the voltage- clamped currents of young and mature neurons generate action potentials appropriate in duration and ionic dependence for each developmental stage. Moreover, the observed changes in the currents are quantitatively sufficient to produce the changes in the action potential. The effect of the change in each current is detectable in the model. However, the increase in amplitude of the delayed-rectifier potassium current has the largest effect. The model further shows that changes in action potential duration could be achieved with changes in kinetics rather than amplitude of this current, or with changes in amplitudes of other currents. Thus, although increase in amplitude of the delayed rectifier plays a pivotal role in the maturation of excitability, it is not uniquely positioned to govern the action potential duration.},

We introduce a channel-based model for this neuron and show how bifurcation analysis can be used to investigate the response of this model to changes of its parameters. Two dimensional maps of the parameter space of the model were constructed using computational tools based on the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems. Changes in the intrinsic firing and oscillatory properties of the model AB neuron were correlated with the boundaries of Hopf and saddle-node bifurcations on these maps. Complex rhythmic patterns were observed, with a bounded region of the parameter plane producing bursting behavior of the model neuron. Experiments were performed by treating an isolated AB cell with 4-aminopyridine which selectively reduces gA, the conductance of the transient potassium channel. The model accurately predicts the qualitative changes in the neuronal voltage oscillations that are observed over a range of reduction of gA in the neuron. These results demonstrate the efficacy of dynamical systems theory as a means of determining the varied oscillatory behaviors inherent in a channel-based neural model. Further, the maps of bifurcations provide a useful tool for determining how these behaviors depend upon model parameters and comparing the model to a real neuron.},

  abstract = {I have used neurophysiological techniques to study the biophysical properties of the Lateral Pyloric cell of the Stomatogastric Ganglion in the rock crab Cancer borealis. Using this cell as a model cell of the pyloric system, the goal was to study the dependence of the excitability of this cell on the different ionic currents it expresses. Thus the strategy I have used is to identify as many ionic currents as could be detected, describe their properties, and use them to generate a computer program that would incorporate all of them into a model cell that reproduces the basic features of the activity of the real cell. This technique can then be used to study in detail the excitability properties of the cell and the contribution each current makes to its general activity.
I identified seven time and/or voltage dependent conductances: a delayed rectifier current, a Ca\$$\backslash$sp\{++\}\$-activated outward current, an A-like current, a Ca\$$\backslash$sp\{++\}\$ current, an inwardly rectifying current, a TTX-sensitive inward current, and a new voltage dependent current activated by the pentapeptide proctolin. Additionally, I observed three voltage independent currents: a leak current, a component of which may be Ca\$$\backslash$sp\{++\}\$-dependent and two GABA activated currents, one that partially resembles the known GABA\$$\backslash$sb\{$\backslash$rm B\}\$ activated current and another GABA activated cationic current. The proctolin activated current shows a voltage dependence that allows it to strongly influence the excitability of the cell in spite of its small amplitude.
The computer generated model cell shows the surprising result that the action potential termination in this cell is mostly due to the activation of the Ca\$$\backslash$sp\{++\}\$-activated current and not the delayed rectifier. It shows also how the relative contribution of each ionic current to the activity of the cell is modified when the peptide proctolin activates a separate, independent current. In the future this model could be used as the basis to explore the contribution of neuronal geometry to cellular activity.
I describe a cell culture protocol for Stomatogastric neurons and some preliminary electrophysiological data on these cells.},

  abstract = {The neurotransmitters mediating the synaptic interactions among the neurons of the pyloric system of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the lobster, Panulirus interruptus, were examined using a combination of electrophysiological, pharmacological, and biochemical techniques. Iontophoretically applied L-glutamate inhibited all motor neurons of the pyloric system. This inhibitory response was blocked by low concentrations of picrotoxin but unaffected by atropine. The anterior burster (AB) interneuron, pyloric dilator (PD) motor neurons, and ventricular dilator (VD) motor neuron were depolarized and excited by iontophoretically applied acetylcholine (ACh). The lateral pyloric (LP) and pyloric (PY) constrictor motor neurons were inhibited by ACh and by the cholinergic agonist, carbachol. These inhibitory cholinergic responses were blocked by atropine but not by picrotoxin. The inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) evoked by the constrictor motor neurons were blocked by picrotoxin but not by atropine. Taken together with previously published data (15, 18), this suggests that the constrictor motor neurons release glutamate at both their excitatory neuromuscular junctions and their inhibitory intraganglionic junctions. The lucifer yellow photoinactivation technique (27) was used to study separately the neurotransmitters released by the electrically coupled PD and AB neurons. The AB-evoked IPSPs were blocked by picrotoxin but not by atropine. The PD-evoked IPSPs were blocked by atropine and other muscarinic antagonists but not by picrotoxin. Somata of PD neurons contained choline acetyltransferase (CAT) activity, but somata of AB neurons contained no detectable CAT activity. On the basis of the data in this paper and previously published data (17, 18), we conclude that the PD neurons release ACh at both their excitatory neuromuscular junctions and their inhibitory intraganglionic connections. Although the AB neuron is electrically coupled to the PD neurons, the AB neuron is not cholinergic. Glutamate is a likely transmitter candidate for the AB neuron. These data show that electrically coupled neurons can release different transmitters. Furthermore, these data show that an IPSP can be the result of the combined actions of two different neurotransmitters, each released from a different neuron. The functional consequences of these conclusions are explored in the following papers (9, 22).},

  abstract = {1. The pyloric dilator (PD) and anterior burster (AB) neurons in the pyloric system of the lobster stomatogastric ganglion are electrically coupled and synchronously active. We have used the lucifer yellow photoinactivation technique to separate the connections made by the PD motor neurons from those made by the AB interneuron. 2. Photoinactivation of either the two PD neurons or the single AB neuron allowed us to separate the compound inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in the lateral pyloric (LP) and pyloric (PY) motor neurons resulting from synchronous PD and AB activity into AB-evoked and PD-evoked components. These IPSPs have different time courses, reversal potentials, ion selectivities, and pharmacological properties. 3. Photoinactivation and membrane-potential manipulations indicated that a readily observable IPSP recorded in the AB neuron and correlated with action potentials in the LP neuron is actually an electrotonic potential due to an LP-evoked IPSP in the PD neurons. 4. Selective inactivation of either the two PD neurons or the AB neuron revealed that the IPSP recorded in the ventricular dilator (VD) motor neuron is due solely to AB-released transmitter. 5. The electrical coupling potentials measurable between the AB, PD, and VD neuron somata are due to direct electrical coupling between all of these neurons. 6. Circuit analysis and transmitter identification may be complicated by electrical coupling. We suggest that the presence of electrical coupling between nonidentical neurons may provide a new mechanism that allows changes in synaptic characteristics among neurons within a "hard-wired" circuit.},

  abstract = {The notion that biological systems come to embody optimal solutions seems consistent with the competitive drive of evolution. It has been used to interpret many examples of sensorimotor behavior. It is attractive from the viewpoint of control engineers because it solves the redundancy problem by identifying the one optimal motor strategy out of many similarly acceptable possibilities. This perspective examines whether there is sufficient basis to apply the formal engineering tools of optimal control to a reductionist understanding of biological systems. For an experimental biologist, this translates into whether the theory of optimal control generates nontrivial and testable hypotheses that accurately predict novel phenomena, ideally at deeper levels of structure than the observable behavior. The methodology of optimal control is applicable when there is (i) a single, known cost function to be optimized, (ii) an invertible model of the plant, and (iii) simple noise interfering with optimal performance. None of these is likely to be true for biological organisms. Furthermore, their motivation is usually good-enough rather than globally optimal behavior. Even then, the performance of a biological organism is often much farther from optimal than the physical limits of its hardware because the brain is continuously testing the acceptable limits of performance as well as just performing the task. This perspective considers an alternative strategy called "good-enough" control, in which the organism uses trial-and-error learning to acquire a repertoire of sensorimotor behaviors that are known to be useful, but not necessarily optimal. This leads to a diversity of solutions that tends to confer robustness on the individual organism and its evolution. It is also more consistent with the capabilities of higher sensorimotor structures, such as cerebral cortex, which seems to be designed to classify and recall complex sets of information, thereby allowing the organism to learn from experience, rather than to compute new strategies online. Optimal control has been a useful metaphor for understanding some superficial aspects of motor psychophysics. Reductionists who want to understand the underlying neural mechanisms need to move on.},

  abstract = {The principles governing neural pattern generation were studied in the pyloric subsystem of lobster stomatogastric ganglion. Quantitative estimates were obtained for repetitive-firing and synaptic-interaction parameters for use in developing quantitative theories (including computer models) of ganglion functioning. 1. The neurons fired tonically to depolarizing current steps, adapting to about 30\% of initial frequency along a compound exponential with time-constants around 0.3 and 3.5 s. 2. Both initial and final firing frequencies to depolarizing current steps were approximately logarithmic with current over a substantial current range (2–10 nA). 3. Post-hyperpolarization rebound was exhibited by all cell types. Its magnitude was a linear function of current in some but not all cases. In simple cases build-up followed a compound exponential with time constants similar to those for adaptation. 4. Synaptic potentials were of two general types: sharprising (tpeak≃12 ms) and rounded (tpeak≃80 ms). 5. Effective synaptic strengths were measured between neuron types. In some cases the strengths were sufficient to expect complete shut-off of moderate activity in postsynaptic elements by moderate activity in presynaptic elements. 6. Certain properties of the system enhance switch-like on/off activity in each cell, which could contribute to burst generation and to appropriate phasing of bursts in the activity cycle.},

  abstract = {All network dynamics emerge from the complex interaction between the intrinsic membrane properties of network neurons and their synaptic connections. Nervous systems contain numerous amines and neuropeptides that function to both modulate the strength of synaptic connections and the intrinsic properties of network neurons. Consequently network dynamics can be tuned and configured in different ways, as a function of the actions of neuromodulators. General principles of the organization of modulatory systems in nervous systems include: (a) many neurons and networks are multiply modulated, (b) there is extensive convergence and divergence in modulator action, and (c) some modulators may be released extrinsically to the modulated circuit, while others may be released by some of the circuit neurons themselves, and act intrinsically. Some of the computational consequences of these features of modulator action are discussed.},

  abstract = {The shal gene encodes the transient potassium current (IA) in neurons of the lobster stomatogastric ganglion. Overexpression of Shal by RNA injection into neurons produces a large increase in IA, but surprisingly little change in the neuron's firing properties. Accompanying the increase in IA is a dramatic and linearly correlated increase in the hyperpolarization-activated inward current (Ih). The enhanced Ih electrophysiologically compensates for the enhanced IA, since pharmacological blockade of Ih uncovers the physiological effects of the increased IA. Expression of a nonfunctional mutant Shal also induces a large increase in Ih, demonstrating a novel activity-independent coupling between the Shal protein and Ih enhancement. Since IA and Ih influence neuronal activity in opposite directions, our results suggest a selective coregulation of these channels as a mechanism for constraining cell activity within appropriate physiological parameters.},

For optimal compression, the neuron's response should match the statistics of stimuli encountered in nature. Given a maximum firing rate, a nerve cell should learn to use each available firing rate equally often. Given a set mean firing rate, it should self-organize to respond with high firing rates only to comparatively rare events. Here we derive an unsupervised learning rule that continuously adapts membrane conductances of a Hodgkin-Huxley model neuron to optimize the representation of sensory information in the firing rate. Maximizing information transfer between the stimulus and the cell's firing rate can be interpreted as a non-Hebbian developmental mechanism.},

Given a limited range of possible firing rates, how do neurons maintain responsiveness to both small and large synaptic inputs? We demonstrate that in response to changes in activity, cultured cortical pyramidal neurons regulate intrinsic excitability to promote stability in firing. Depriving pyramidal neurons of activity for two days increased sensitivity to current injection by selectively regulating voltage-dependent conductances. This suggests that one mechanism by which neurons maintain sensitivity to different levels of synaptic input is by altering the function relating current to firing rate.},

To explore the validity of this procedure, we studied the behavior of a conductance-based model neuron with five voltage-dependent conductances. We randomly varied the maximal conductance of each of the active currents in the model and identified sets of maximal conductances that generate bursting neurons that fire a single action potential at the peak of a slow membrane potential depolarization. A model constructed using the means of the maximal conductances of this population is not itself a one-spike burster, but rather fires three action potentials per burst. Averaging fails because the maximal conductances of the population of one-spike bursters lie in a highly concave region of parameter space that does not contain its mean. This demonstrates that averages over multiple samples can fail to characterize a system whose behavior depends on interactions involving a number of highly variable components.},

  issn = {0022-3077},
  abstract = {1. We explore the roles of conductances in Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) models using a method that allows the explicit linking of HH model input-output behavior to parameter values for maximal conductances, voltage shifts, and time constants. The procedure can be used to identify not only the parameter values most critical to supporting a neuronal activity pattern of interest but also the relationships between parameters which may be required, e.g., limited ranges of relative magnitudes. 2. The method is the repeated use of stochastic search to find hundreds or even thousands of different sets of model parameter values that allow a HH model to produce a desired behavior, such as current-frequency transduction, to within a desired tolerance, e.g., frequency match to within 10 Hz. Graphical or other analysis may then be performed to reveal the shape and boundaries of the parameter solution regions that support the desired behavior. 3. The shape of these parameter regions can reveal parameter values and relationships essential to the behavior. For instance, graphical display may reveal covariances between maximal conductance values, or a much wider range of variation in some maximal conductance values than in others. 4. We demonstrate the use of these techniques with simple, representative HH models, primarily that of Connor et al. for crustacean walking leg axons, but also some extensions of the results are explored using the more complex model of McCormick and Huguenard for thalamocortical relay neurons. Both models are single compartment. Behaviors studied include current-to-frequency transduction, the time delay to first action potential in response to current steps, and the timing of action potential occurrences in response to both square-wave current injection and the injection of currents derived from in vitro records of excitatory postsynaptic currents. 5. Using these simple models, we find that relatively general behaviors such as current-frequency (I/F) curves may be supported by very broad, but bounded parameter solution regions, with the shape of the solution regions revealing the relative importance of the maximal conductances of a model in creating the behavior. Furthermore, we find that a focus on increasingly specific behaviors, such as I/F behavior, defined by tolerances of only a few hertz combined with strict requirements for action potential height, inevitably leads to increasingly narrow, and eventually nonphysiologically narrow, regions of acceptable parameter values. 6. We use the Connor et al. model to reproduce the in vitro action potential timing responses of a rat brain stem neuron to various stimuli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

The paucity of homologous character data across disparately related lineages currently renders direct phylogenetic inference untenable. To reconstruct a comprehensive tree of life, we therefore synthesized published phylogenies, together with taxonomic classifications for taxa never incorporated into a phylogeny. We present a draft tree containing 2.3 million tips—the Open Tree of Life. Realization of this tree required the assembly of two additional community resources: (i) a comprehensive global reference taxonomy and (ii) a database of published phylogenetic trees mapped to this taxonomy. Our open source framework facilitates community comment and contribution, enabling the tree to be continuously updated when new phylogenetic and taxonomic data become digitally available. Although data coverage and phylogenetic conflict across the Open Tree of Life illuminate gaps in both the underlying data available for phylogenetic reconstruction and the publication of trees as digital objects, the tree provides a compelling starting point for community contribution. This comprehensive tree will fuel fundamental research on the nature of biological diversity, ultimately providing up-to-date phylogenies for downstream applications in comparative biology, ecology, conservation biology, climate change, agriculture, and genomics.},

These puzzling lies arise systematically when assertions are forced. Intellectual duress helps to explain another type of non-deceptive false assertion: lying to yourself.

  abstract = {Biologically detailed single neuron and network models are important for understanding how ion channels, synapses and anatomical connectivity underlie the complex electrical behavior of the brain. While neuronal simulators such as NEURON, GENESIS, MOOSE, NEST, and PSICS facilitate the development of these data-driven neuronal models, the specialized languages they employ are generally not interoperable, limiting model accessibility and preventing reuse of model components and cross-simulator validation. To overcome these problems we have used an Open Source software approach to develop NeuroML, a neuronal model description language based on XML (Extensible Markup Language). This enables these detailed models and their components to be defined in a standalone form, allowing them to be used across multiple simulators and archived in a standardized format. Here we describe the structure of NeuroML and demonstrate its scope by converting into NeuroML models of a number of different voltage- and ligand-gated conductances, models of electrical coupling, synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity, together with morphologically detailed models of individual neurons. We have also used these NeuroML-based components to develop an highly detailed cortical network model. NeuroML-based model descriptions were validated by demonstrating similar model behavior across five independently developed simulators. Although our results confirm that simulations run on different simulators converge, they reveal limits to model interoperability, by showing that for some models convergence only occurs at high levels of spatial and temporal discretisation, when the computational overhead is high. Our development of NeuroML as a common description language for biophysically detailed neuronal and network models enables interoperability across multiple simulation environments, thereby improving model transparency, accessibility and reuse in computational neuroscience.},

ModelDB was founded in 1996 to support this new field and enhance the scientific credibility and utility of computational neuroscience models by providing a convenient venue for sharing them. It has grown to include over 1100 published models covering more than 130 research topics. It is actively curated and developed to help researchers discover and understand models of interest. ModelDB also provides mechanisms to assist running models both locally and remotely, and has a graphical tool that enables users to explore the anatomical and biophysical properties that are represented in a model. Each of its capabilities is undergoing continued refinement and improvement in response to user experience. Large research groups (Allen Brain Institute, EU Human Brain Project, etc.) are emerging that collect data across multiple scales and integrate that data into many complex models, presenting new challenges of scale. We end by predicting a future for neuroscience increasingly fueled by new technology and high performance computation, and increasingly in need of comprehensive user-friendly databases such as ModelDB to provide the means to integrate the data for deeper insights into brain function in health and disease.},

  abstract = {Simulating biological neuronal networks is a core method of research in computational neuroscience. A full specification of such a network model includes a description of the dynamics and state changes of neurons and synapses, as well as the synaptic connectivity patterns and the initial values of all parameters. A standard approach in neuronal modelling software is to build models based on a library of pre-defined models and mechanisms; if a model component does not yet exist, it has to be defined in a special-purpose or general low-level language and potentially be compiled and linked with the simulator. Here we propose an alternative approach that allows flexible definition of models by writing textual descriptions based on mathematical notation. We demonstrate that this approach allows the definition of a wide range of models with minimal syntax. Furthermore, such explicit model descriptions allow the generation of executable code for various target languages and devices, since the description is not tied to an implementation. Finally, this approach also has advantages for readability and reproducibility, because the model description is fully explicit, and because it can be automatically parsed and transformed into formatted descriptions.The presented approach has been implemented in the Brian2 simulator.},

  abstract = {Computational neuroscience has produced a diversity of software for simulations of networks of spiking neurons, with both negative and positive consequences. On the one hand, each simulator uses its own programming or configuration language, leading to considerable difficulty in porting models from one simulator to another. This impedes communication between investigators and makes it harder to reproduce and build on the work of others. On the other hand, simulation results can be cross-checked between different simulators, giving greater confidence in their correctness, and each simulator has different optimizations, so the most appropriate simulator can be chosen for a given modelling task. A common programming interface to multiple simulators would reduce or eliminate the problems of simulator diversity while retaining the benefits. PyNN is such an interface, making it possible to write a simulation script once, using the Python programming language, and run it without modification on any supported simulator (currently NEURON, NEST, PCSIM, Brian and the Heidelberg VLSI neuromorphic hardware). PyNN increases the productivity of neuronal network modelling by providing high-level abstraction, by promoting code sharing and reuse, and by providing a foundation for simulator-agnostic analysis, visualization, and data-management tools. PyNN increases the reliability of modelling studies by making it much easier to check results on multiple simulators.

Thus, it is difficult to assess the efficiency of these models to solve complex problems such as image processing. Here, we describe how this problem can be tackled using event-driven computation. Only the neurons that emit a discharge are processed and, as long as the average spike discharge rate is low, millions of neurons and billions of connections can be modelled. We describe the underlying computation and implementation of such a mechanism in SpikeNET, our neural network simulation package. The type of model one can build is not only biologically compliant, it is also computationally efficient as 400 000 synaptic weights can be propagated per second on a standard desktop computer. In addition, for large networks, we can set very small time steps ($<$0.01 ms) without significantly increasing the computation time. As an example, this method is applied to solve complex cognitive tasks such as face recognition in natural images.},

It is designed to speed up and simplify the process of generating, sharing, and exploring network models of neurons with one or more compartments. Models can be specified by equations directly (similar to XPP or the Brian simulator) or by lists of predefined or custom model components. The higher-level specification supports arbitrarily complex population models and networks of interconnected populations. DynaSim also includes a large set of features that simplify exploring model dynamics over parameter spaces, running simulations in parallel using both multicore processors and high-performance computer clusters, and analyzing and plotting large numbers of simulated data sets in parallel. It also includes a graphical user interface (DynaSim GUI) that supports full functionality without requiring user programming. The software has been implemented in MATLAB to enable advanced neural modeling using MATLAB, given its popularity and a growing interest in modeling neural systems. The design of DynaSim incorporates a novel schema for model specification to facilitate future interoperability with other specifications (e.g., NeuroML, SBML), simulators (e.g., NEURON, Brian, NEST), and web-based applications (e.g., Geppetto) outside MATLAB.

  abstract = {Endogenous amines and peptides continuously modulate the activity of neuronal networks and are required even for their normal operation. The respiratory rhythm generator, localized in the pre-Bötzinger complex, is not an exception. This network is modulated by various neurotransmitters, including serotonin (5-HT). In this study, we isolated the respiratory network in brainstem slices and demonstrate that the endogenous activation of 5-HT2A is required for the generation of the respiratory rhythm in vitro. At the network level, activation of 5-HT2A receptors with 4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyamphetamine or the 5-HT uptake blocker alaproclate increased the frequency of respiratory activity. Blockade of endogenously activated 5-HT2A receptors with three different antagonists decreased the frequency, amplitude, and regularity of respiratory population activity, an effect that was blocked by protein kinase C (PKC) activators. At the cellular level, blockade of 5-HT2A receptors reduced the action potential discharge in all examined respiratory neurons, which was associated with a reduction in the fast and the persistent sodium current. Continuous application of 5-HT2A-receptor antagonists differentially affected pacemaker neurons. Pacemaker activity was eliminated in cadmium-insensitive pacemaker neurons. In cadmium-sensitive pacemaker neurons, the frequency of pacemaker activity was unaffected and the amplitude of pacemaker bursts was enhanced. It is assumed that cadmium-insensitive pacemakers rely on the persistent sodium current, whereas cadmium-sensitive pacemakers depend on the activation of calcium currents. We conclude that endogenously activated 5-HT2A receptors are required for maintaining fictive respiratory activity in the brainstem slice by modulating sodium conductances via a PKC pathway.},

  abstract = {The respiratory system is continuously modulated by numerous aminergic and peptidergic substances that act at all levels of integration: from the sensory level to the level of central networks and motor nuclei. The same neuronal networks receive inputs from multiple modulators released locally as well as from distal nuclei. All parameters of respiratory control are controlled by multiple neuromodulators. By partly converging onto similar G-proteins and second messenger systems, acetylcholine, norepinephrine, histamine, serotonin (5-HT), dopamine, ATP, substance P, cholecystokinin (CCK) can increase frequency, regularity and amplitude of respiratory activity. Yet, the same modulator can also exert differential effects on respiratory activity by acting on different receptors partly in the same neurons. In the pre-Bötzinger complex (pre-BötC) modulators can differentially modulate frequency and amplitude in different types of pacemaker neurons. Similarly motoneurons located in different motor nuclei receive differential amplitude modulation from different modulators. Thus, modulators are capable of orchestrating and modulating different parameters of respiratory activity by differentially targeting different cellular targets. A disturbance in modulatory control may lead to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and erratic breathing.},

After 6 hrs isoproterenol (240 micrograms) was administered to compare the effects of cortisol with a beta-agonist bronchodilator. Serum cortisol levels remained greater than 100 micrograms/dl after cortisol and normal after placebo. Cortisol had no effect on pulmonary function except for a trend of improved flows and decreasing ratios of residual volume to total lung capacity in asthmatics that was not significant at 6 hr. Isoproterenol resulted in immediate improvement in specific conductance and flows in both groups; no interaction with cortisol was seen. We conclude that cortisol had no short-term effect on airway caliber in normals, at best a slowly evolving effect in asymptomatic unmedicated asthmatics, and no interaction with the bronchodilator effects of a maximal dose of isoproterenol in these groups.},

  abstract = {The modulation of the pyloric rhythm of the stomatogastric ganglion of the crab, Cancer borealis, by crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) is described. CCAP activated pyloric rhythms in most silent preparations, and altered the phase relationships of pyloric motor neuron firing in all preparations. In CCAP, the pyloric rhythms were characterized by long lateral pyloric (LP) neuron bursts of action potentials. The threshold for CCAP action was approximately 10(-10) M, with increasing effects at higher CCAP concentrations. The changes in motor pattern evoked by CCAP produced significant changes in LP-innervated muscle movement. These movements were additionally potentiated by CCAP applications to isolated nerve-muscle preparations. Thus, enhanced motor neuron firing and increase of the gain of the neuromuscular junctions are likely to operate coordinately in response to hormonally released CCAP. High CCAP concentrations sometimes resulted in modification of the normal 1:1 alternation between the pyloric dilator (PD) and LP neurons to patterns of 2:1, 3:1, or 4:1 alternation. CCAP seems to activate slow intrinsic oscillations in the LP neuron, as well as enhance faster oscillations in the pacemaker group of PD/anterior burster (AB) neurons. Simulations of fast and slow oscillators with reciprocal inhibitory coupling suggest mechanisms that could account for the mode switch from 1:1 alternation to multiple PD bursts alternating with one LP neuron burst.},

Here, we focus on the flexibility afforded to microcircuits by such co-transmission, using examples from various nervous systems. Insights from such studies indicate that co-transmission mediated even by a single neuron can configure microcircuit activity via an array of contributing mechanisms, operating on multiple timescales, to enhance both behavioural flexibility and robustness.},

  abstract = {The crustacean pyloric Central Pattern Generator (CPG) is a nervous circuit that endogenously provides periodic motor patterns. Even after about 40 years of intensive studies, the rhythm genesis is still not rigorously understood in this CPG, mainly because it is made of neurons with irregular intrinsic activity. Using mathematical models we addressed the question of using a network of irregularly behaving elements to generate periodic oscillations, and we show some advantages of using non-periodic neurons with intrinsic behavior in the transition from bursting to tonic spiking (as found in biological pyloric CPGs) as building components. We studied two- and three-neuron model CPGs built either with Hindmarsh-Rose or with conductance-based Hodgkin-Huxley-like model neurons. By changing a model’s parameter we could span the neuron’s intrinsic dynamical behavior from slow periodic bursting to fast tonic spiking, passing through a transition where irregular bursting was observed. Two-neuron CPG, half center oscillator (HCO), was obtained for each intrinsic behavior of the neurons by coupling them with mutual symmetric synaptic inhibition. Most of these HCOs presented regular antiphasic bursting activity and the changes of the bursting frequencies was studied as a function of the inhibitory synaptic strength. Among all HCOs, those made of intrinsic irregular neurons presented a wider burst frequency range while keeping a reliable regular oscillatory (bursting) behavior. HCOs of periodic neurons tended to be either hard to change their behavior with synaptic strength variations (slow periodic burster neurons) or unable to perform a physiologically meaningful rhythm (fast tonic spiking neurons). Moreover, 3-neuron CPGs with connectivity and output similar to those of the pyloric CPG presented the same results.},

Over a broad range of “permissive” temperatures, the pyloric rhythm increases in frequency but maintains its characteristic phase relationships. Nonetheless, at more extreme high temperatures, the normal triphasic pyloric rhythm breaks down, or “crashes”. We present both experimental and computational approaches to understanding the stability of both single neurons and networks to temperature perturbations, and discuss data that shows that the “crash” temperatures themselves may be environmentally regulated. These approaches provide insight into how the nervous system can be stable to a global perturbation, such as temperature, in spite of the fact that all biological processes are temperature dependent.},

To reliably encode a wide range of signals, neurons need to achieve a broad range of firing frequencies and to move smoothly between low and high firing rates. This can be achieved with specific ionic currents, such as A-type potassium currents, which can linearize the frequency-input current curve. By applying recently developed mathematical tools to a number of biophysical neuron models, we show how currents that are classically thought to permit low firing rates can paradoxically cause a jump to a high minimum firing rate when expressed at higher levels. Consequently, achieving and maintaining a low firing rate is surprisingly difficult and fragile in a biological context. This difficulty can be overcome via interactions between multiple currents, implying a need for ion channel degeneracy in the tuning of neuronal properties.},

Fluctuations in temperature pose a problem to the nervous systems of poikilotherms because their body temperature follows the ambient temperature, thus affecting the temperature-dependent dynamics of various subcellular components that constitute neuronal circuits. In the crustacean stomatogastric nervous system, the pyloric circuit produces a triphasic rhythm comprising the output of the pyloric dilator, lateral pyloric, and pyloric constrictor neurons. In vitro, the phase relationships of these neurons are maintained over a fourfold change in pyloric frequency as temperature increases from 7°C to 23°C. To determine whether these temperature effects are also found in intact crabs, in the presence of sensory feedback and neuromodulator-rich environments, we measured the temperature dependence of the pyloric frequency and phases in vivo by implanting extracellular electrodes into Cancer borealis and Cancer pagurus and shifting tank water temperature from 11°C to 26°C. Pyloric frequency in the intact crab increased significantly with temperature (Q10 = 2–2.5), while pyloric phases were generally conserved. For a subset of the C. borealis experiments, animals were subsequently dissected and the stomatogastric ganglion subjected to a similar temperature ramp in vitro. We found that the maximal frequency attained at high temperatures in vivo is lower than it is under in vitro conditions. Our results demonstrate that, over a wide temperature range, the phases of the pyloric rhythm in vivo are generally preserved, but that the frequency range is more restricted than it is in vitro.},

Moreover, the kinetics of ion channels, maximal conductances, and Ca2+ buffering each have independent temperature sensitivities, suggesting that the balance of biological parameters can be disturbed by even modest temperature changes. In stomatogastric ganglia of the crab Cancer borealis, the duty cycle of the bursting pacemaker kernel is highly robust between 7 and 23°C (Rinberg et al., 2013). We examined how this might be achieved in a detailed conductance-based model in which exponential temperature sensitivities were given by Q10 parameters. We assessed the temperature robustness of this model across 125,000 random sets of Q10 parameters. To examine how robustness might be achieved across a variable population of animals, we repeated this analysis across six sets of maximal conductance parameters that produced similar activity at 11°C. Many permissible combinations of maximal conductance and Q10 parameters were found over broad regions of parameter space and relatively few correlations among Q10s were observed across successful parameter sets. A significant portion of Q10 sets worked for at least 3 of the 6 maximal conductance sets (∼11.1\%). Nonetheless, no Q10 set produced robust function across all six maximal conductance sets, suggesting that maximal conductance parameters critically contribute to temperature robustness. Overall, these results provide insight into principles of temperature robustness in neuronal oscillators.},

  abstract = {The crab Cancer borealis undergoes large daily fluctuations in environmental temperature (8–24°C) and must maintain appropriate neural function in the face of this perturbation. In the pyloric circuit of the crab stomatogastric ganglion, we pharmacologically isolated the pacemaker kernel (the AB and PD neurons) and characterized its behavior in response to temperature ramps from 7°C to 31°C. For moderate temperatures, the pacemaker displayed a frequency-temperature curve statistically indistinguishable from that of the intact circuit, and like the intact circuit maintained a constant duty cycle. At high temperatures (above 23°C), a variety of different behaviors were seen: in some preparations the pacemaker increased in frequency, in some it slowed, and in many preparations the pacemaker stopped oscillating (“crashed”). Furthermore, these crashes seemed to fall into two qualitatively different classes. Additionally, the animal-to-animal variability in frequency increased at high temperatures. We used a series of Morris-Lecar mathematical models to gain insight into these phenomena. The biophysical components of the final model have temperature sensitivities similar to those found in nature, and can crash via two qualitatively different mechanisms that resemble those observed experimentally. The crash type is determined by the precise parameters of the model at the reference temperature, 11°C, which could explain why some preparations seem to crash in one way and some in another. Furthermore, even models with very similar behavior at the reference temperature diverge greatly at high temperatures, resembling the experimental observations., The nervous systems of cold-blooded animals must maintain essential function despite fluctuations in environmental temperature. We studied the pyloric rhythm of the crab, Cancer borealis. The pyloric rhythm is important for the animal's feeding behavior, and previous work has shown that relative timing, or phase, of the neurons in the pyloric circuit is temperature invariant over a range of physiologically realistic temperatures (7 to 23°C), although the frequency of the rhythm increases. At higher temperatures, the rhythm often becomes disorganized or stops. In this paper we present experimental work on the isolated pacemaker of the pyloric rhythm together with a computational model that explores the loss of stability of the pacemaker as a function of temperature. Experimentally, we found that the isolated pacemaker responds to temperature similarly to the intact network, and maintains constant duty cycle over large temperature ranges. At high temperatures, about half of the pacemakers stop oscillating, reminiscent of certain mathematical bifurcations. We varied the temperature dependence and conductance densities of a simple model oscillator, and characterized its bifurcations as a function of temperature. We found that particular temperature-dependent relationships must be maintained to provide robust temperature performance of oscillators with variable underlying conductances.},

  abstract = {Recent computational and experimental work has shown that similar network performance can result from variable sets of synaptic and intrinsic properties. Because temperature is a global perturbation that differentially influences every biological process within the nervous system, one might therefore expect that individual animals would respond differently to temperature. Nonetheless, the phase relationships of the pyloric rhythm of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab, Cancer borealis, are remarkably invariant between 7 and 23°C (Tang et al., 2010). Here, we report that, when isolated STG preparations were exposed to more extreme temperature ranges, their networks became nonrhythmic, or "crashed", in a reversible fashion. Animals were acclimated for at least 3 weeks at 7, 11, or 19°C. When networks from the acclimated animals were perturbed by acute physiologically relevant temperature ramps (11-23°C), the network frequency and phase relationships were independent of the acclimation group. At high acute temperatures ($>$23°C), circuits from the cold-acclimated animals produced less-regular pyloric rhythms than those from warm-acclimated animals. At high acute temperatures, phase relationships between pyloric neurons were more variable from animal to animal than at moderate acute temperatures, suggesting that individual differences across animals in intrinsic circuit parameters are revealed at high temperatures. This shows that individual and variable neuronal circuits can behave similarly in normal conditions, but their behavior may diverge when confronted with extreme external perturbations.},

General principles of the organization of these circuits and their control by higher brain centers have come from the study of smaller circuits found in invertebrates. Recent work on vertebrates highlights the importance of neuro-modulatory control pathways in enabling spinal cord and brain stem circuits to generate meaningful motor patterns. Because rhythmic motor patterns are easily quantified and studied, central pattern generators will provide important testing grounds for understanding the effects of numerous genetic mutations on behavior. Moreover, further understanding of the modulation of spinal cord circuitry used in rhythmic behaviors should facilitate the development of new treatments to enhance recovery after spinal cord damage.},

The distribution of red pigment concentrating hormone (RPCH)-like immunoreactivity (RPLI) in the stomatogastric nervous system of the crab, Cancer borealis, was studied using whole-mount immunocytochemistry. RPLI was seen in neuropilar processes in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG), and in somata in the oesophageal ganglion and commissural ganglia. Staining was blocked by preincubating the antiserum with RPCH, as well as with a number of adipokinetic hormones (AKHs) and related peptides.
Synthetic RPCH had strong actions on the pyloric rhythm of the isolated STG. Bath applications of RPCH (10−9-10−6moll−1) increased the cycle frequency in preparations displaying slow pyloric rhythms, and initiated rhythmic pyloric activity in silent preparations. In the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), RPCH evoked rhythmic non-impulse-mediated alternations in membrane potential in the lateral pyloric and pyloric dilator motor neurones. The effects of RPCH were compared to those of a series of AKHs which resemble RPCH structurally.
The immunocytochemical and physiological data together suggest that RPCH or a similar molecule is a neurally released modulator of the STG.},

In neural circuit activity, presumed GABAergic excitation was observed in basolateral amygdala during the study of a neuropeptide, cholecystokinin. Though the functional meaning of this phenomenon in vivo remains to be uncovered, it may be implicated in epilepsy or anxiety in the adult brain.},

Using a combination of optogenetics and two-photon calcium imaging in vivo, we find that activation of chloride-permeable GABAA receptors in parallel fibers of the cerebellar molecular layer of adult mice causes parallel fiber excitation. Stimulation of parallel fibers at submaximal stimulus intensities leads to GABA release from molecular layer interneurons, thus creating a positive feedback loop that enhances excitation near the center of an activated parallel fiber bundle. Our results imply that elevated chloride concentration can occur in specific intracellular compartments of mature mammalian neurons and suggest an excitatory role for GABAA receptors in the cerebellar cortex of adult mice.},

  abstract = {Brain regions typically contain intermixed subpopulations of neurons with different connectivity and neurotransmitters. This complicates identification of neuronal phenotypes in electrophysiological experiments without using direct detection of unique molecular markers. A prime example of this difficulty is the identification of dopamine (DA) neurons in the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA). Although immunocytochemistry (ICC) against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is widely used to identify DA neurons, a high false negative rate for TH ICC following ex vivo electrophysiology experiments was recently reported, calling into question the validity of comparing DA and non-DA VTA neurons based on post-hoc ICC. However, in whole cell recordings from randomly selected rat VTA neurons we have found that TH labeling is consistently detected in ∼55\% of neurons even after long recording durations (range: 2.5–150 min). This is consistent with our prior anatomical finding that 55\% of VTA neurons are TH(+). To directly estimate a false negative rate for our ICC method we recorded VTA neurons from mice in which EGFP production is driven by the TH promoter. All 12 EGFP(+) neurons recorded with a K-gluconate internal solution (as used in our rat recordings) were strongly labeled by TH ICC (recording duration 16.6±1.8 min). However, using recording electrodes with an internal solution with high Cl− concentration reduced the intensity of TH co-labeling, in some cases to background (recording duration 16.7±0.9 min; n = 10). Thus TH is a highly reliable molecular marker for DA neurons in VTA patch clamp recordings provided compatible microelectrode solutions are used.},

  abstract = {Multiple neuromodulators continuously act in concert to shape the properties of neural circuits. Different neurmodulators can activate distinct receptors but have overlapping signaling pathways or targets through co-modulation. Mechanisms underlying circuit output and its functional consequences, therefore, depend on how neuromodulators interact on these shared targets, a process that is poorly understood. We explored the quantitative rules of co-modulation of two principal targets of neuromodulation, voltage-gated ionic currents and synaptic currents, in the pyloric circuit of the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab, Cancer borealis. The neuropeptides proctolin (Proc) and CCAP modulate STG synapses and converge to activate the voltage-gated ionic current IMI in multiple STG neurons. Using simultaneous voltage-clamp recordings from the reciprocally connected pyloric neurons PD and LP, we examined the validity of a simple dose-dependent quantitative rule that co-modulation by Proc and CCAP can be predicted as the linear sum of the individual effects of each modulator, up to saturation. We found that this rule is valid for the co-modulation of the synapses between these two neurons, but not for the activation of IMI, where co-modulation was found to be sublinear. Given the high level of evolutionary conservation of neuromodulator receptors and signaling pathways, such distinct rules for co-modulation of different components within the same neurons are likely to be common across neuronal circuits.},

This is dependent on the synaptic parameters given the same circuit architecture, thus illustrating the insufficiency of the connectome alone for determining circuit behavior.

When does neuromodulation of a single neuron influence the output of the entire network? We constructed a five-cell circuit in which a neuron is at the center of the circuit and the remaining neurons form two distinct oscillatory subnetworks. All neurons were modeled as modified Morris−Lecar models with a hyperpolarization-activated conductance (ḡh) in addition to calcium (ḡCa), potassium (ḡK), and leak conductances. We determined the effects of varying ḡCa, ḡK, and ḡh on the frequency, amplitude, and duty cycle of a single neuron oscillator. The frequency of the single neuron was highest when the ḡK and ḡh conductances were high and ḡCa was moderate whereas, in the traditional Morris−Lecar model, the highest frequencies occur when both ḡK and ḡCa are high.
We randomly sampled parameter space to find 143 hub oscillators with nearly identical frequencies but with disparate maximal conductance, duty cycles, and burst amplitudes, and then embedded each of these hub neurons into networks with different sets of synaptic parameters. For one set of network parameters, circuit behavior was virtually identical regardless of the underlying conductances of the hub neuron. For a different set of network parameters, circuit behavior varied with the maximal conductances of the hub neuron. This demonstrates that neuromodulation of a single target neuron may dramatically alter the performance of an entire network when the network is in one state, but have almost no effect when the circuit is in a different state.},

In this paper, we provide the first detailed and quantitative analyses of the short- and long-term effects of removal of these descending inputs (decentralization) on the pyloric rhythm of the STG. Thirty minutes after decentralization, the mean frequency of the pyloric rhythm dropped from 1.20 Hz in control to 0.52 Hz. Whereas the relative phase of pyloric neuron activity was approximately constant across frequency in the controls, after decentralization this changed markedly. Nine control preparations kept for 5–6 d in vitro maintained pyloric rhythm frequencies close to their initial values. Nineteen decentralized preparations kept for 5–6 d dropped slightly in frequency from those seen at 30 min following decentralization, but then displayed stable activity over 6 d. Bouts of higher frequency activity were intermittently seen in both control and decentralized preparations, but the bouts began earlier and were more frequent in the decentralized preparations. Although the bouts may indicate that the removal of the modulatory inputs triggered changes in neuronal excitability, these changes did not produce obvious long-lasting changes in the frequency of the decentralized preparations.},

Ambiguities in interpreting the results of electrophysiological recordings can arise if sets of pre- or postsynaptic neurons are electrically coupled, or if the electrical coupling exhibits some specificity (e.g. rectifying, or voltage-dependent). Even in small circuits, electrical coupling can produce parallel pathways that can allow information to travel by monosynaptic and/or polysynaptic pathways. Consequently, similar changes in circuit dynamics can arise from entirely different underlying mechanisms. When neurons are coupled both chemically and electrically, modifying the relative strengths of the two interactions provides a mechanism for flexibility in circuit outputs.

  abstract = {The cardiac ganglion (CG) of Homarus americanus is a central pattern generator that consists of two oscillatory groups of neurons: “small cells” (SCs) and “large cells” (LCs). We have shown that SCs and LCs begin their bursts nearly simultaneously but end their bursts at variable phases. This variability contrasts with many other central pattern generator systems in which phase is well maintained. To determine both the consequences of this variability and how CG phasing is controlled, we modeled the CG as a pair of Morris-Lecar oscillators coupled by electrical and excitatory synapses and constructed a database of 15,000 simulated networks using random parameter sets. These simulations, like our experimental results, displayed variable phase relationships, with the bursts beginning together but ending at variable phases. The model suggests that the variable phasing of the pattern has important implications for the functional role of the excitatory synapses. In networks in which the two oscillators had similar duty cycles, the excitatory coupling functioned to increase cycle frequency. In networks with disparate duty cycles, it functioned to decrease network frequency. Overall, we suggest that the phasing of the CG may vary without compromising appropriate motor output and that this variability may critically determine how the network behaves in response to manipulations.},

In invertebrates, the gap junction proteins are coded for by the innexin family of genes. The stomatogastric ganglion (STG) in the crab Cancer borealis contains a small number of identified and electrically coupled neurons. We identified Innexin 1 (Inx1), Innexin 2 (Inx2), Innexin 3 (Inx3), Innexin 4 (Inx4), Innexin 5 (Inx5), and Innexin 6 (Inx6) members of the C. borealis innexin family. We also identified six members of the innexin family from the lobster Homarus americanus transcriptome. These innexins show significant sequence similarity to other arthropod innexins. Using in situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), we determined that all the cells in the crab STG express multiple innexin genes. Electrophysiological recordings of coupling coefficients between identified pairs of pyloric dilator (PD) cells and PD-lateral posterior gastric (LPG) neurons show that the PD-PD electrical synapse is nonrectifying while the PD-LPG synapse is apparently strongly rectifying.},

Many of the early studies turned to the “simple” systems of invertebrates in the hope of discovering the components of circuits and their connections. A striking finding was the existence of “command neurons” in arthropods and molluscs that produce complex and coordinated movements when stimulated (1, 2). The challenge was then to identify the connections between these neurons and other neurons important for those behaviors. This approach was always limited to examining only a few neurons from the tens or hundreds of thousands in the animal (3). On page 386 of this issue, Vogelstein et al.

  abstract = {Motor neuron activity is transformed into muscle movement through a cascade of complex molecular and biomechanical events. This nonlinear mapping of neural inputs to motor behaviors is called the neuromuscular transform (NMT). We examined the NMT in the cardiac system of the lobster Homarus americanus by stimulating a cardiac motor nerve with rhythmic bursts of action potentials and measuring muscle movements in response to different stimulation patterns. The NMT was similar across preparations, which suggested that it could be used to predict muscle movement from spontaneous neural activity in the intact heart. We assessed this possibility across semi-intact heart preparations in two separate analyses. First, we performed a linear regression analysis across 122 preparations in physiological saline to predict muscle movements from neural activity. Under these conditions, the NMT was predictive of contraction duty cycle but was unable to predict contraction amplitude, likely as a result of uncontrolled interanimal variability. Second, we assessed the ability of the NMT to predict changes in motor output induced by the neuropeptide C-type allatostatin. Wiwatpanit et al. (2012) showed that bath application of C-type allatostatin produced either increases or decreases in the amplitude of the lobster heart contractions. We show that an important component of these preparation-dependent effects can arise from quantifiable differences in the basal state of each preparation and the nonlinear form of the NMT. These results illustrate how properly characterizing the relationships between neural activity and measurable physiological outputs can provide insight into seemingly idiosyncratic effects of neuromodulators across individuals.},

In this study, we use computational models to investigate how rectifying electrical synapses change the behavior of a small neuronal network that exhibits complex rhythmic output patterns. We begin with an electrically coupled circuit of three oscillatory neurons with different starting frequencies, and subsequently add two additional neurons and inhibitory chemical synapses. The five-cell model represents a pattern-generating neuronal network with two simultaneous rhythms competing for the recruitment of a hub neuron. We compare four different configurations of rectifying synapse placement and polarity, and we investigate how rectification changes the functional output of this network. Rectification can have a striking effect on the network's sensitivity to alterations of the strengths of the chemical synapses in the network. For some configurations, the rectification makes the circuit dynamics remarkably robust against changes in synaptic strength compared with the nonrectifying case. Based on our findings, we predict that modulation of rectifying electrical synapses could have functional consequences for the neuronal circuits that express them.},

First, how the neurons comprising the circuit are connected, and second, how neurons and their connections change after learning or in response to neuromodulators. Neuronal connectivity is difficult to determine experimentally, whereas neuronal activity can often be readily measured. We describe a statistical model to estimate circuit connectivity directly from measured activity patterns. We use the timing relationships between observed spikes to predict synaptic interactions between simultaneously observed neurons. The model estimate provides each predicted connection with a curve that represents how strongly, and at which temporal delays, one circuit element effectively influences another. These curves are analogous to synaptic interactions of the level of the membrane potential of biological neurons and share some of their features such as being inhibitory or excitatory. We test our method on recordings from the pyloric circuit in the crab stomatogastric ganglion, a small circuit whose connectivity is completely known beforehand, and find that the predicted circuit matches the biological one — a result other techniques failed to achieve. In addition, we show that drug manipulations impacting the circuit are revealed by this technique. These results illustrate the utility of our analysis approach for inferring connections from neural spiking activity.},

Rhythmic oscillations are common features of nervous systems. One of the fundamental questions posed by these rhythms is how individual neurons or groups of neurons are recruited into different network oscillations. We modeled competing fast and slow oscillators connected to a hub neuron with electrical and inhibitory synapses. We explore the patterns of coordination shown in the network as a function of the electrical coupling and inhibitory synapse strengths with the help of a novel visualization method that we call the “parameterscape.” The hub neuron can be switched between the fast and slow oscillators by multiple network mechanisms, indicating that a given change in network state can be achieved by degenerate cellular mechanisms. These results have importance for interpreting experiments employing optogenetic, genetic, and pharmacological manipulations to understand circuit dynamics.},

RPCH produced several-fold increases in the amplitude of both action potential–mediated and non–impulse-mediated transmission that persisted for as long as the peptide remained present. Because the LP to PD synapse is the only feedback to the pacemaker kernel of the pyloric network, which consists of the electrically coupled two PD neurons and the anterior burster (AB) neuron, it might have been expected that strengthening the LP to PD synapse would increase the period of the pyloric rhythm. However, the period of the pyloric rhythm increased only transiently in RPCH, and a transient increase in cycle period was observed even when the LP neuron was hyperpolarized. Phase response curves were measured using the dynamic clamp to create artificial inhibitory inputs of variable strength and duration to the PD neurons. Synaptic conductance values seen in normal saline were ineffective at changing the pyloric period throughout the pyloric cycle. Conductances similar to those seen in 10−6 M RPCH also did not evoke phase resets at phases when the LP neuron is typically active. Thus the dramatic effects of RPCH on synaptic strength have little role in modulation of the period of the pyloric rhythm under normal operating conditions but may help to stabilize the rhythm when the cycle period is too slow or too fast.},

Based on respiratory nerve discharge, the respiratory cycle can be divided into three phases: inspiration, postinspiration and stage 2 expiration. 2. Six basic types of respiratory neuron participate in respiratory rhythmogenesis. Their firing and membrane potential patterns are locked to different phases of the respiratory cycle. 3. In adult mammals, respiratory neurons are subject to excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs and show extensive synaptic interconnections that are mainly inhibitory. There are differences in the relative importance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic drives and the neurotransmitters involved in respiratory rhythmogenesis in neonates compared with adults. 4. Respiratory neurons possess a number of intrinsic membrane currents that may be involved in central pattern generation, including low- and high-voltage-activated calcium, potassium, calcium-dependent potassium, sodium and mixed cationic currents. More quantitative information is needed about the distribution and characteristics of these ionic currents if we are to understand rhythmogenesis. 5. The two main theories for the origin of respiratory rhythm are those of pacemaker neuron-driven and synaptic network-driven CPG. Evidence derived from in vivo and in vitro experiments exists to support both of these theories. There may be a significant switch in the underlying mechanism driving the respiratory CPG during postnatal development.},

Understanding how these biophysical differences affect network-level computation is an important frontier. We focus on a set of biophysical properties, experimentally observed in developing cortical neurons, that allow these neurons to efficiently encode their inputs despite time-varying changes in the statistical context. Large-scale propagating waves are autonomously generated by the developing brain even before the onset of sensory experience. Using multi-layered feedforward networks, we examine how changes in intrinsic properties can lead to changes in the network's ability to represent and transmit information on multiple timescales. We demonstrate that measured changes in the computational properties of immature single neurons enable the propagation of slow-varying wave-like inputs. In contrast, neurons with more mature properties are more sensitive to fast fluctuations, which modulate the slow-varying information. While slow events are transmitted with high fidelity in initial network layers, noise degrades transmission in downstream network layers. Our results show how short-term adaptation and modulation of the neurons' input-output firing curves by background synaptic noise determine the ability of neural networks to transmit information on multiple timescales.},

Oscillations in neural activity are a prominent feature of many brain states. Individual hippocampal neurons exhibit intrinsic membrane potential oscillations and intrinsic resonance in the theta frequency range. We found that the subthreshold resonance frequency of CA1 pyramidal neurons was location dependent, varying more than 3-fold between the soma and the distal dendrites. Furthermore, activity- and NMDA-receptor-dependent long-term plasticity increased this resonance frequency through changes in h channel properties. The increase in resonance frequency and an associated reduction in excitability were nearly identical in the soma and the first 300 μm of the apical dendrites. These spatially widespread changes accompanying long-term synaptic potentiation also reduced the neuron's ability to elicit spikes evoked through a nonpotentiated synaptic pathway. Our results suggest that the frequency response of these neurons depends on the dendritic location of their inputs and that activity can regulate their response dynamics within an oscillating neural network.},

Induction of one type of LTP--observed at synapses in the CA1 region of the mammalian hippocampus--is regulated by the voltage of the postsynaptic cell. To date, a similar form of LTP has not been demonstrated for any invertebrate synapse. We now report that high-frequency stimulation can induce LTP of sensorimotor synapses of the marine mollusc Aplysia in cell culture. Moreover, induction of this form of LTP appears to involve a voltage-dependent postsynaptic mechanism because pairing tetanic stimulation of the presynaptic cell with strong hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic cell blocks the induction of LTP.},

  abstract = {Changes in temperature affect biochemical reaction rates and, consequently, neural processing. The nervous systems of poikilothermic animals must have evolved mechanisms enabling them to retain their functionality under varying temperatures. Auditory receptor neurons of grasshoppers respond to sound in a surprisingly temperature-compensated manner: firing rates depend moderately on temperature, with average Q10 values around 1.5. Analysis of conductance-based neuron models reveals that temperature compensation of spike generation can be achieved solely relying on cell-intrinsic processes and despite a strong dependence of ion conductances on temperature. Remarkably, this type of temperature compensation need not come at an additional metabolic cost of spike generation. Firing rate-based information transfer is likely to increase with temperature and we derive predictions for an optimal temperature dependence of the tympanal transduction process fostering temperature compensation. The example of auditory receptor neurons demonstrates how neurons may exploit single-cell mechanisms to cope with multiple constraints in parallel., DOI:
http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02078.001, Warm-blooded animals—including mammals and birds—expend large amounts of energy in keeping their body temperature constant regardless of how hot or cold their environment is. By contrast, the body temperature of cold-blooded animals—including amphibians, reptiles, and insects—follows that of their surroundings. Cold-blooded animals must therefore have evolved a means to cope with the effects of changes in temperature, but exactly how they do this is not clear., Now, Roemschied et al. have obtained new insights into this process by studying the nerve cells in grasshoppers that allow them to hear sounds. The auditory system of the grasshopper comprises sensory receptor neurons that are located on the abdomen of the insect. Sound waves move the tympanal membrane, which causes ion channels within the cell membranes to open. This enables the neurons to produce an electrical signal known as a spike., Recordings from grasshoppers revealed that changing the outside temperature by up to 10°C affected the rate at which the neurons produced spikes by only about half the amount expected. Given that these neurons do not receive inputs from any other cells, this ability to withstand changes in temperature must be intrinsic to the neurons themselves. Consistent with this, computational modeling showed that while the activity of individual ion channels did indeed vary with changes in temperature, these changes in ion channel activity had little overall effect on the rate at which a neuron produced spikes., Whereas it has previously been assumed that compensation for changes in temperature occurs at the level of networks of neurons, the work of Roemschied et al. reveals that such compensation can occur in individual cells, and that it need not require a lot of energy to be expended., DOI:

Here we provide a review of the realistic simulation strategy and use the cerebellar network as an example. This network has been carefully investigated at molecular and cellular level and has been the object of intense theoretical investigation. The cerebellum is thought to lie at the core of the forward controller operations of the brain and to implement timing and sensory prediction functions. The cerebellum is well described and provides a challenging field in which one of the most advanced realistic microcircuit models has been generated. We illustrate how these models can be elaborated and embedded into robotic control systems to gain insight into how the cellular properties of cerebellar neurons emerge in integrated behaviors. Realistic network modeling opens up new perspectives for the investigation of brain pathologies and for the neurorobotic field.},

  abstract = {Central Pattern Generator (CPG) circuits are neural networks that generate rhythmic motor patterns. These circuits are typically built of half-center oscillator subcircuits with reciprocally inhibitory connections. Another common property in many CPGs is the remarkable rich spiking-bursting dynamics of their constituent cells, which balance robustness and flexibility to generate their joint coordinated rhythms. In this paper, we use conductance-based models and realistic connection topologies inspired by the crustacean pyloric CPG to address the study of asymmetry factors shaping CPG bursting rhythms. In particular, we assess the role of asymmetric maximal synaptic conductances, time constants and gap-junction connectivity to establish the regularity of half-center oscillator based CPGs. We map and characterize the synaptic parameter space that lead to regular and irregular bursting activity in these networks. The analysis indicates that asymmetric configurations display robust regular rhythms and that large regions of both regular and irregular but coordinated rhythms exist as a function of the asymmetry in the circuit. Our results show that asymmetry both in the maximal conductances and in the temporal dynamics of mutually inhibitory neurons can synergistically contribute to shape wide regimes of regular spiking-bursting activity in CPGs. Finally, we discuss how a closed-loop protocol driven by a regularity goal can be used to find and characterize regular regimes when there is not time to perform an exhaustive search, as in most experimental studies.},

Although the number of neurons is generally assumed to be a determinant of computational power, and despite the widespread quotes that the human brain contains 100 billion neurons and ten times more glial cells, the absolute number of neurons and glial cells in the human brain remains unknown. Here we determine these numbers by using the isotropic fractionator and compare them with the expected values for a human-sized primate. We find that the adult male human brain contains on average 86.1 +/- 8.1 billion NeuN-positive cells ("neurons") and 84.6 +/- 9.8 billion NeuN-negative ("nonneuronal") cells. With only 19\% of all neurons located in the cerebral cortex, greater cortical size (representing 82\% of total brain mass) in humans compared with other primates does not reflect an increased relative number of cortical neurons. The ratios between glial cells and neurons in the human brain structures are similar to those found in other primates, and their numbers of cells match those expected for a primate of human proportions. These findings challenge the common view that humans stand out from other primates in their brain composition and indicate that, with regard to numbers of neuronal and nonneuronal cells, the human brain is an isometrically scaled-up primate brain.},

Applying this approach to a local network of neurons in the neocortex revealed a remarkably intricate and previously unseen topology of synaptic connectivity. The synaptic network contains an abundance of cliques of neurons bound into cavities that guide the emergence of correlated activity. In response to stimuli, correlated activity binds synaptically connected neurons into functional cliques and cavities that evolve in a stereotypical sequence towards peak complexity. We propose that the brain processes stimuli by forming increasingly complex functional cliques and cavities.},

Incorporating morphological detail into a model allows for additional analysis of non-homogeneous distributions of active and synaptic conductances, as well as spatial segregation of electrical events. We developed a morphologically detailed “Full Model” of a leech heart interneuron that replicates reasonably well intracellular recordings from these interneurons. However, it comprises hundreds of compartments, each increasing parameter space and simulation time. To reduce the number of compartments of the Full Model, while preserving conductance densities and distributions, its compartments were grouped into functional groups that each share identical conductance densities. Each functional group was sequentially reduced to one or two compartments, preserving surface area, conductance densities and its contribution to input resistance. As a result, the input resistance and membrane time constant were preserved. The axial resistances of several compartments were rescaled to match the amplitude of synaptic currents and low-threshold calcium currents and the shape of action potentials to those in the Full Model. This reduced model, with intrinsic conductances, matched the activity of the Full Model for a variety of simulated current-clamp and voltage-clamp data. Because surface area and conductance distribution of the functional groups of the Full Model were maintained, parameter changes introduced into the reduced model can be directly translated to the Full Model. Thus, our computationally efficient reduced morphology model can be used as a tool for exploring the parameter space of the Full Model and in network simulations.},

Numerical solutions may be obtained for any particular model by inserting expressions describing the terminations and parameter values into the program, without further computation by the modeler. For a finite length cable, sealed at one end, the solution is expressed in terms of the ratio of the termination impedance to the impedance of the finite length cable, a generalization of the steady-state conductance ratio. Analysis of a model of a soma with several primary dendrites shows that the dendrites may be lumped into one equivalent cylinder if they have the same electrotonic length, even though they may vary in diameter. Responses obtained under voltage clamp are conceptually predictable from measurements made under current clamp, and vice versa. The equalizing time constants of an infinite series expression of the solution are the negative reciprocals of the roots of the characteristic equation. Examination of computed solutions shows that solutions which differ theoretically may be indistinguishable experimentally.},

By using information theoretical concepts, we develop here functional measures of the degeneracy and redundancy of a system with respect to a set of outputs. These measures help to distinguish the concept of degeneracy from that of redundancy and make it operationally useful. Through computer simulations of neural systems differing in connectivity, we show that degeneracy is low both for systems in which each element affects the output independently and for redundant systems in which many elements can affect the output in a similar way but do not have independent effects. By contrast, degeneracy is high for systems in which many different elements can affect the output in a similar way and at the same time can have independent effects. We demonstrate that networks that have been selected for degeneracy have high values of complexity, a measure of the average mutual information between the subsets of a system. These measures promise to be useful in characterizing and understanding the functional robustness and adaptability of biological networks.},

We now report that proctolin depolarizes these cells maximally at membrane potentials close to the threshold for action potential generation. In voltage clamp, proctolin evokes an inward current, carried at least partially by Na+, that shows strong outward rectification. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ markedly increases the amplitude of the proctolin-evoked current and linearizes its current-voltage curve. The properties of the proctolin current make it ideally suited to contribute to the activity-dependent modulation of the pyloric network of the STG.},

One of these peptides, proctolin, activates an inward current that shows strong outward rectification (Golowasch and Marder, 1992). Decreasing the extracellular Ca(2+) concentration linearizes the current-voltage curve of the proctolin-induced current. We used voltage clamp to study the currents evoked by proctolin and five additional modulators [C. borealis tachykinin-related peptide Ia (CabTRP Ia), crustacean cardioactive peptide, red pigment-concentrating hormone, TNRNFLRFamide, and the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine] in stomatogastric ganglion neurons, both in the intact ganglion and in dissociated cell culture. Subtraction currents yielded proctolin-like current-voltage relationships for all six substances, and the current-voltage curves of all six substances showed linearization in low external Ca(2+). The lateral pyloric neuron responded to all six modulators, but the ventricular dilator neuron only responded to a subset of them. Bath application of saturating concentrations of proctolin occluded the response to CabTRP and vice versa. N-(6-Aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-napthalensulfonamide, a calmodulin inhibitor, increased the amplitude and altered the voltage dependence of the responses elicited by CabTRP and proctolin. Together, these data indicate that all six substances converge onto the same voltage-dependent current, although they activate different receptors. Therefore, differential network responses evoked by these substances may primarily depend on the receptor distribution on network neurons.},

We show here that each of these modulators acts on a distinct subset of pyloric network neurons in the STG. To ask whether the differences in cell targets could account for their differential effects on the pyloric rhythm, we systematically compared the motor patterns produced by proctolin and CCAP. The motor patterns produced in proctolin and CCAP differed quantitatively in a number of ways. Proctolin and CCAP both act on the lateral pyloric neuron and the inferior cardiac neuron. Proctolin additionally acts on the pyloric dilator (PD) neurons, the pyloric (PY) neurons, and the ventricular dilator neuron. Using the dynamic clamp, we introduced an artificial peptide-elicited current into the PD and PY neurons, in the presence of CCAP, and converted the CCAP rhythm into a rhythm that was statistically similar to that seen in proctolin. This suggests that the differences in the network effects of these two modulators can primarily be attributed to the known differential distributions of their receptors onto distinct subsets of neurons, despite the fact that they activate the same current.},

Current-voltage curves also showed the response to be voltage-dependent, with a reversal potential at positive membrane potentials. The response was blocked in sodium-free solutions. Solutions with reduced sodium concentration caused a shift of the reversal potential in a manner expected for a response that is largely sodium-dependent.

Principal temperature sensors belong to the TRP cation channel family, but the mechanisms underlying the marked temperature sensitivity of opening and closing (‘gating’) of these channels are unknown. Here we show that temperature sensing is tightly linked to voltage-dependent gating in the cold-sensitive channel TRPM8 and the heat-sensitive channel TRPV1. Both channels are activated upon depolarization, and changes in temperature result in graded shifts of their voltage-dependent activation curves. The chemical agonists menthol (TRPM8) and capsaicin (TRPV1) function as gating modifiers, shifting activation curves towards physiological membrane potentials. Kinetic analysis of gating at different temperatures indicates that temperature sensitivity in TRPM8 and TRPV1 arises from a tenfold difference in the activation energies associated with voltage-dependent opening and closing. Our results suggest a simple unifying principle that explains both cold and heat sensitivity in TRP channels.},

Reciprocally inhibitory pairs of heart interneurons form oscillators that pace the heartbeat rhythm. Other heart interneurons coordinate these oscillators. These coordinating interneurons, along with the oscillator interneurons, form an eight-cell timing oscillator network for heartbeat. Still other interneurons, along with the oscillator interneurons, inhibit heart motor neurons, sculpting their activity into rhythmic bursts. Critical switch interneurons interface between the oscillator interneurons and the other premotor interneurons to produce two alternating coordination states of the motor neurons. The periods of the oscillator interneurons are modulated by endogenous RFamide neuropeptides. We have explored the ionic currents and graded and spike-mediated synaptic transmission that promote oscillation in the oscillator interneurons and have incorporated these data into a conductance-based computer model. This model has been of considerable predictive value and has led to new insights into how reciprocally inhibitory neurons produce oscillation. We are now in a strong position to expand this model upward, to encompass the entire heartbeat network, horizontally, to elucidate the mechanisms of FMRFamide modulation, and downward, to incorporate cellular morphology. By studying the mechanisms of motor pattern formation in the leech, using modeling studies in conjunction with parallel physiological experiments, we can contribute to a deeper understanding of how rhythmic motor acts are generated, coordinated, modulated, and reconfigured at the level of networks, cells, ionic currents, and synapses. © 1995 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Motor pattern generating networks that produce segmentally distributed motor outflow are often portrayed as a series of coupled segmental oscillators that produce a regular progression (constant phase differences) in their rhythmic activity. The leech heartbeat central pattern generator is paced by a core timing network, which consists of two coupled segmental oscillators in segmental ganglia 3 and 4. The segmental oscillators comprise paired mutually inhibitory oscillator interneurons and the processes of intersegmental coordinating interneurons. As a first step in understanding the coordination of segmental motor outflow by this pattern generator, we describe the functional synaptic interactions, and activity and phase relationships of the heart interneurons of the timing network, in isolated nerve cord preparations. In the timing network, most (∼75\%) of the coordinating interneuron action potentials were generated at a primary spike initiation site located in ganglion 4 (G4). A secondary spike initiation site in ganglion 3 (G3) became active in the absence of activity at the primary site. Generally, the secondary site was characterized by a reluctance to burst and a lower spike frequency, when compared with the primary site. Oscillator interneurons in G3 inhibited spike activity at both initiation sites, whereas oscillator interneurons in G4 inhibited spike activity only at the primary initiation site. This asymmetry in the control of spike activity in the coordinating interneurons may account for the observation that the phase of the coordinating interneurons is more tightly linked to the G3 than G4 oscillator interneurons. The cycle period of the timing network and the phase difference between the ipsilateral G3 and G4 oscillator interneurons were regular within individual preparations, but varied among preparations. This variation in phase differences observed across preparations implies that modulated intrinsic membrane and synaptic properties, rather than the pattern of synaptic connections, are instrumental in determining phase within the timing network.},

Cardiac rhythm management devices provide therapies for both arrhythmias and resynchronisation but not heart failure, which affects millions of patients worldwide. This paper reviews recent advances in biophysics and mathematical engineering that provide a novel technological platform for addressing heart disease and enabling beat-to-beat adaptation of cardiac pacing in response to physiological feedback. The technology consists of silicon hardware central pattern generators (hCPGs) that may be trained to emulate accurately the dynamical response of biological central pattern generators (bCPGs). We discuss the limitations of present CPGs and appraise the advantages of analog over digital circuits for application in bioelectronic medicine. To test the system, we have focused on the cardio-respiratory oscillators in the medulla oblongata that modulate heart rate in phase with respiration to induce respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). We describe here a novel, scalable hCPG comprising physiologically realistic (Hodgkin–Huxley type) neurones and synapses. Our hCPG comprises two neurones that antagonise each other to provide rhythmic motor drive to the vagus nerve to slow the heart. We show how recent advances in modelling allow the motor output to adapt to physiological feedback such as respiration. In rats, we report on the restoration of RSA using an hCPG that receives diaphragmatic electromyography input and use it to stimulate the vagus nerve at specific time points of the respiratory cycle to slow the heart rate. We have validated the adaptation of stimulation to alterations in respiratory rate. We demonstrate that the hCPG is tuneable in terms of the depth and timing of the RSA relative to respiratory phase. These pioneering studies will now permit an analysis of the physiological role of RSA as well as its any potential therapeutic use in cardiac disease.},

  abstract = {The heartbeat central pattern generator (CPG) in medicinal leeches controls blood flow within a closed circulatory by programming the constrictions of two parallel heart tubes. This circuit reliably produces a stereotyped fictive pattern of activity and has been extensively characterized. Here we determined, as quantitatively as possible, the strength of each inhibitory synapse and electrical junction within the core circuit of the heartbeat CPG. We also examined the animal-to-animal variability in strengths of these connections and, for some, determined the correlations between connections to the same postsynaptic target. The core CPG is composed of seven bilateral pairs of heart interneurons connected via both inhibitory chemical synapses and electrical junctions. Fifteen different connections within the core CPG were measured for strength using extracellular presynaptic recordings and postsynaptic voltage-clamp recordings across a minimum of seven individuals each, and the animal-to-animal variability was characterized. Connection strengths within the core network varied three to more than sevenfold among individuals (depending on the specific connection). The balance between two inputs onto various postsynaptic targets was explored by within-individual comparisons and correlation across individuals. Of the seven comparisons made within the core CPG, three showed a clear correlation of connection strengths, while the other four did not. We conclude that the leech heartbeat CPG can withstand wide variability in connection strengths and still produce stereotyped output. The network appears to preserve the relative strengths of some pairs of inputs, despite the animal-to-animal variability.},

  abstract = {This investigation of the leech heartbeat neural network system led to the development of a low resources, real-time, biomimetic digital hardware for use in hybrid experiments. The leech heartbeat neural network is one of the simplest central pattern generators (CPG). In biology, CPG provide the rhythmic bursts of spikes that form the basis for all muscle contraction orders (heartbeat) and locomotion (walking, running, etc.). The leech neural network system was previously investigated and this CPG formalized in the Hodgkin–Huxley neural model (HH), the most complex devised to date. However, the resources required for a neural model are proportional to its complexity. In response to this issue, this article describes a biomimetic implementation of a network of 240 CPGs in an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array), using a simple model (Izhikevich) and proposes a new synapse model: activity-dependent depression synapse. The network implementation architecture operates on a single computation core. This digital system works in real-time, requires few resources, and has the same bursting activity behavior as the complex model. The implementation of this CPG was initially validated by comparing it with a simulation of the complex model. Its activity was then matched with pharmacological data from the rat spinal cord activity. This digital system opens the way for future hybrid experiments and represents an important step toward hybridization of biological tissue and artificial neural networks. This CPG network is also likely to be useful for mimicking the locomotion activity of various animals and developing hybrid experiments for neuroprosthesis development.},

Abrupt cooling of isolated nerve cords can induce additional changes in heart rate that are associated with ‘paradoxical’ firing of motor neurons. 3.Heart rate was accelerated when mechanical stimuli were applied to the body wall of partially dissected preparations or when restrained preparations spontaneously initiated movements. For instance, marked acceleration of heart rate occurred when preparations exhibited body movements and motor neuron activity characteristic of swimming in intact animals. Activation of the motor program for swimming in isolated nerve cords led to acceleration of heartbeat oscillator cycling. Accelerations of heart rate associated with swimming are therefore mediated at least partially through central interactions. 4.Individual identified neurons were tested for their influence on the cycle rate of the heartbeat oscillator in isolated nerve cords. Activity of individual mechanosensory neurons was found to accelerate heart rate. Touch mechanosensory neurons were also found to influence the heartbeat oscillator through a rapidly adapting inhibitory pathway. Activity of individual motorneurons generally did not affect heart rate. Some interneurons and neuroeffector cells known to cause motor activation (e.g. swim initiating interneurons, serotonergic Retzius cells) can also produce acceleration of heart rate.},

  abstract = {We have created a computational model of the timing network that paces the heartbeat of the medicinal leech,Hirudo medicinalis. The rhythmic activity of this network originates from two segmental oscillators located in the third and fourth midbody ganglia. In the intact nerve cord, these segmental oscillators are mutually entrained to the same cycle period. Although experiments have shown that the segmental oscillators are coupled by inhibitory coordinating interneurons, the underlying mechanisms of intersegmental coordination have not yet been elucidated. To help understand this coordination, we have created a simple computational model with two variants: symmetric and asymmetric. In the symmetric model, neurons within each segmental oscillator called oscillator interneurons, inhibit the coordinating interneurons. In contrast, in the asymmetric model only the oscillator interneurons of one segmental oscillator inhibit the coordinating interneurons. In the symmetric model, when two segmental oscillators with different inherent periods are coupled, the faster one leads in phase, and the period of the coupled system is equal to the period of the faster oscillator. This behavior arises because, during each oscillation cycle, the oscillator interneurons of the faster segmental oscillator begin to burst before those of the slower oscillator, thereby terminating spike activity in the coordinating interneurons. Thus there is a brief period of time in each cycle when the oscillator interneurons of the slower segmental oscillator are relieved of inhibition from the coordinating interneurons. This “removal of synaptic inhibition” allows, within certain limits, the slower segmental oscillator to be sped to the period of the faster one. Thus the symmetric model demonstrates a plausible biophysical mechanism by which one segmental oscillator can entrain the other. In general the asymmetric model, in which only one segmental oscillator has the ability to inhibit the coordinating interneurons, behaves similarly, except only one segmental oscillator can control the period of the system. In addition, we simulated physiological experiments in which a “driving” stimulus, consisting of alternating positive and negative current steps, was used to control a single oscillator interneuron and thereby entrain the activity of the entire timing network.},

  abstract = {Recent experimental and computational studies suggest that linearly correlated sets of parameters (intrinsic and synaptic properties of neurons) allow central pattern-generating networks to produce and maintain their rhythmic activity regardless of changing internal and external conditions. To determine the role of correlated conductances in the robust maintenance of functional bursting activity, we used our existing database of half-center oscillator (HCO) model instances of the leech heartbeat CPG. From the database, we identified functional activity groups of burster (isolated neuron) and half-center oscillator model instances and realistic subgroups of each that showed burst characteristics (principally period and spike frequency) similar to the animal. To find linear correlations among the conductance parameters maintaining functional leech bursting activity, we applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to each of these four groups. PCA identified a set of three maximal conductances (leak current, 
Leak; a persistent K current, 
K2; and of a persistent Na+ current, 
P) that correlate linearly for the two groups of burster instances but not for the HCO groups. Visualizations of HCO instances in a reduced space suggested that there might be non-linear relationships between these parameters for these instances. Experimental studies have shown that period is a key attribute influenced by modulatory inputs and temperature variations in heart interneurons. Thus, we explored the sensitivity of period to changes in maximal conductances of 
Leak, 
K2, and 
P, and we found that for our realistic bursters the effect of these parameters on period could not be assessed because when varied individually bursting activity was not maintained., Central pattern-generating networks (CPGs) must be remarkably robust, maintaining functional rhythmic activity despite fluctuations in internal and external conditions. Recent experimental evidence suggests that this robustness is achieved by the coordinated regulation of many membrane and synaptic current parameters. Experimental and computational studies showed that linearly correlated sets of such parameters allow CPG neurons to produce and maintain their rhythmic activity. However, the mechanisms that allow multiple parameters to interact, thereby producing and maintaining rhythmic single cell and network activity, are not clear. Here, we use a half-center oscillator (HCO) model that replicates the electrical activity (rhythmic alternating bursting of mutually inhibitory interneurons) of the leech heartbeat CPG to investigate potential relationships between parameters that maintain functional bursting activity in the HCOs and the isolated component neurons (bursters). We found a linearly correlated set of three maximal conductances that maintains functional bursting activity similar to the animal in burster model instances, therefore increasing robustness of bursting activity. In addition, we found that bursting activity was very sensitive to individual variation of these parameters; only correlated changes could maintain the activity type.},

This model represents a network of six heart interneurons that comprise the basic rhythm-generating network within a single ganglion. This model builds on a previous two cell model (Nadim et al., 1995) by incorporating modifications of intrinsic and synaptic currents based on the results of a realistic waveform voltage-clamp study (Olsen and Calabrese, 1996). Due to these modifications, the new model behaves more similarly to the biological system than the previous model. For example, the slow-wave oscillation of membrane potential that underlies bursting is similar in form and amplitude to that of the biological system. Furthermore, the new model with its expanded architecture demonstrates how coordinating interneurons contribute to the oscillations within a single ganglion, in addition to their role of intersegmental coordination.},

  abstract = {To address the general problem of intersegmental coordination of oscillatory neuronal networks, we have studied the leech heartbeat central pattern generator. The core of this pattern generator is a timing network that consists of two segmental oscillators, each of which comprises two identified, reciprocally inhibitory oscillator interneurons. Intersegmental coordination between the segmental oscillators is mediated by synaptic interactions between the oscillator interneurons and identified coordinating interneurons. The small number of neurons (8) and the distributed structure of the timing network have made the experimental analysis of the segmental oscillators as discrete, independent units possible. On the basis of this experimental work, we have made conductance-based models to explore how intersegmental phase and cycle period are determined. We show that although a previous simple model, which ignored many details of the living system, replicated some essential features of the living system, the incorporation of specific cellular and network properties is necessary to capture the behavior of the system seen under different experimental conditions. For example, spike frequency adaptation in the coordinating interneurons and details of asymmetries in intersegmental connectivity are necessary for replicating driving experiments in which one segmental oscillator was injected with periodic current pulses to entrain the activity of the entire network. Nevertheless, the basic mechanisms of phase and period control demonstrated here appear to be very general and could be used by other networks that produce coordinated segmental motor outflow.},

In this study, we identified two additional pairs of interneurons that are part of the swim CPG: swim interneuron 3 (Si3) and swim interneuron 4 (Si4). The somata of Si3 and Si4 were both located in the pedal ganglion, near that of Si2, and both had axons that projected through the pedal commissure to the contralateral pedal ganglion. These neurons fulfilled the criteria for inclusion as members of the swim CPG: 1) they fired at a fixed phase in relation to Si1 and Si2, 2) brief changes in their activity reset the motor pattern, 3) prolonged changes in their activity altered the periodicity of the motor pattern, 4) they had monosynaptic connections with each other and with Si1 and Si2, and 5) their synaptic actions helped explain the phasing of the motor pattern. The results of this study show that the motor pattern has more complex internal dynamics than a simple left/right alternation of firing; the CPG circuit appears to be composed of two kernels of reciprocally inhibitory neurons, one consisting of Si1, Si2, and the contralateral Si4 and the other consisting of Si3. These two kernels interact with each other to produce a stable rhythmic motor pattern.},

It is based on the 4-volume treatise, Handbook of the Cerebellum and Cerebellar Disorders (Springer, 2013), the definitive reference for scientists and neurologists in the field of cerebellar neurobiology. There have been fundamental advances in the basic science and clinical neurology of the cerebellum and its role in sensorimotor function and cognition. This monograph makes this large and expanding body of knowledge readily accessible to trainees and clinicians alike. The editors are world leaders in the field, and the chapters are authored by an international panel of experts drawn from ataxia clinics and cerebellar laboratories throughout North America, Europe and Asia. Essentials provides a solid grounding in the field of cerebellar research and ataxiology from cerebellar circuity to clinical practice, and it serves as a springboard to a deeper appreciation of both the principles and the complexities of cerebellar neurobiology. Clinicians are expected to have a deep appreciation of cerebellar disorders, not only in specialized ataxia clinics but also in adult and pediatric neurology, neurosurgery, psychiatry and neuropsychology practices, and in outpatient and inpatient rehabilitation settings. This book is an indispensable resource for students and practitioners navigating the evolving field of cerebellar motor and cognitive neurology. It also links to the more expansive Handbook for those who need to explore the topics in this monograph in greater depth.},

  abstract = {Extensive work on learning in reaching and pointing tasks has demonstrated high degrees of plasticity in our ability to optimize goal-directed motor behavior. However, studies focusing on the perceptual awareness of our own actions during motor adaptation are still rare. Here we present the first simultaneous investigation of sensorimotor adaptation on both levels, i.e., action and action perception. We hypothesized that self-action perception relies on internal predictions about the sensory action outcome that are updated in a way similar to that of motor control. Twenty human subjects performed out-and-back pointing movements that were fed back visually. Feedback was initially presented in spatiotemporal correspondence with respect to the actual finger position, but later rotated by a constant angle. When distorted feedback was applied repetitively, subjects' perceived pointing direction shifted in the direction of the trajectory rotation. A comparable perceptual reinterpretation was observed in control trials without visual feedback, indicating that subjects learned to predict the new visual outcome of their actions based on nonvisual, internal information. The perception of the world, however, remained unchanged. The changes in perception of one's own movements were accompanied by adaptive changes in motor performance of the same amount, i.e., a secondary motor compensation opposite to the direction of the imposed visual rotation. Our results show that the perception of one's own actions depends on adaptable internal predictions about the sensory action outcome, allowing us to attribute new sensory consequences of our actions to our own agency. Furthermore, they indicate that the updated sensory prediction can be used to optimize motor control.},

This mutation co-segregated with all affected individuals and was not observed in either unaffected family members or in 200 normal unrelated individuals. Biophysical studies indicated that the p.Trp43Arg mutation resulted in significant tertiary structural changes. The mutant protein was much less stable than the wild-type protein, and was more prone to aggregate when subjected to environmental stresses such as heat and UV irradiation. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Twelve children and 12 adults (average age = 10.2 and 26.1 years, respectively) reported whether short phrases described themselves or a highly familiar other (Harry Potter) while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. In both children and adults, the MPFC was relatively more active during self- than social knowledge retrieval, and the MPPC was relatively more active during social than self-knowledge retrieval. Direct comparisons between children and adults indicated that children activated the MPFC during self-knowledge retrieval to a much greater extent than adults. The particular regions of the MPPC involved varied between the two groups, with the posterior precuneus engaged by adults, but the anterior precuneus and posterior cingulate engaged by children. Only children activated the MPFC significantly above baseline during self-knowledge retrieval. Implications for social cognitive development and the processing functions performed by the MPFC are discussed.},

  abstract = {Synapses are specialized cell-cell contacts that mediate communication between neurons. Most excitatory synapses in the brain are housed on dendritic spines, small actin-rich protrusions extending from dendrites. During development and in response to environmental stimuli, spines undergo marked changes in shape and number thought to underlie processes like learning and memory. Improper spine development, in contrast, likely impedes information processing in the brain, since spine abnormalities are associated with numerous brain disorders. Elucidating the mechanisms that regulate the formation and plasticity of spines and their resident synapses is therefore crucial to our understanding of cognition and disease. Rho-family GTPases, key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, play essential roles in orchestrating the development and remodeling of spines and synapses. Precise spatio-temporal regulation of Rho GTPase activity is critical for their function, since aberrant Rho GTPase signaling can cause spine and synapse defects as well as cognitive impairments. Rho GTPases are activated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and inhibited by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). We propose that Rho-family GEFs and GAPs provide the spatiotemporal regulation and signaling specificity necessary for proper Rho GTPase function based on the following features they possess: (i) existence of multiple GEFs and GAPs per Rho GTPase, (ii) developmentally regulated expression, (iii) discrete localization, (iv) ability to bind to and organize specific signaling networks, and (v) tightly regulated activity, perhaps involving GEF/GAP interactions. Recent studies describe several Rho-family GEFs and GAPs that uniquely contribute to spinogenesis and synaptogenesis. Here, we highlight several of these proteins and discuss how they occupy distinct biochemical niches critical for synaptic development.},

Dendritic spines are highly motile structures that can undergo actin-dependent shape changes, which occur over a time scale ranging from seconds to tens of minutes or even days. The formation, remodelling and elimination of excitatory synapses on dendritic spines represent ways of refining the microcircuitry in the brain.

  abstract = {The major mechanism for generating diversity of neuronal connections beyond their genetic determination is the activity-dependent stabilization and selective elimination of the initially overproduced synapses [Changeux JP, Danchin A (1976) Nature 264:705–712]. The largest number of supranumerary synapses has been recorded in the cerebral cortex of human and nonhuman primates. It is generally accepted that synaptic pruning in the cerebral cortex, including prefrontal areas, occurs at puberty and is completed during early adolescence [Huttenlocher PR, et al. (1979) Brain Res 163:195–205]. In the present study we analyzed synaptic spine density on the dendrites of layer IIIC cortico–cortical and layer V cortico–subcortical projecting pyramidal neurons in a large sample of human prefrontal cortices in subjects ranging in age from newborn to 91 y. We confirm that dendritic spine density in childhood exceeds adult values by two- to threefold and begins to decrease during puberty. However, we also obtained evidence that overproduction and developmental remodeling, including substantial elimination of synaptic spines, continues beyond adolescence and throughout the third decade of life before stabilizing at the adult level. Such an extraordinarily long phase of developmental reorganization of cortical neuronal circuitry has implications for understanding the effect of environmental impact on the development of human cognitive and emotional capacities as well as the late onset of human-specific neuropsychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {Previous investigations have combined transcriptional and genetic analyses in human cell lines, but few have applied these techniques to human neural tissue. To gain a global molecular perspective on the role of the human genome in cortical development, function and ageing, we explore the temporal dynamics and genetic control of transcription in human prefrontal cortex in an extensive series of post-mortem brains from fetal development through ageing. We discover a wave of gene expression changes occurring during fetal development which are reversed in early postnatal life. One half-century later in life, this pattern of reversals is mirrored in ageing and in neurodegeneration. Although we identify thousands of robust associations of individual genetic polymorphisms with gene expression, we also demonstrate that there is no association between the total extent of genetic differences between subjects and the global similarity of their transcriptional profiles. Hence, the human genome produces a consistent molecular architecture in the prefrontal cortex, despite millions of genetic differences across individuals and races. To enable further discovery, this entire data set is freely available (from Gene Expression Omnibus: accession GSE30272; and dbGaP: accession phs000417.v1.p1) and can also be interrogated via a biologist-friendly stand-alone application (http://www.libd.org/braincloud).},

His hypothesis has survived 40years of accumulated data, and we review the critical findings related to synaptic dysfunction of schizophrenia. While it is clear that synaptic disturbances are integral and important for understanding the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, it has also become obvious that synaptic disturbances cannot be studied and understood as an independent disease hallmark, but only as a part of a complex network of homeostatic events. Development, glial-neural interaction, changes in energy homeostasis, diverse genetic predisposition, neuroimmune processes and environmental influences all can tip the delicate homeostatic balance of the synaptic morphology and connectivity in a uniquely individual fashion, thus contributing to the emergence of the various symptoms of this devastating disorder. Finally, we argue that based on a predominant change in gene expression pattern we can broadly sub-stratify schizophrenia into "synaptic" "oligodendroglial", "metabolic" and "inflammatory" subclasses.},

The pathophysiological characteristics of schizophrenia appear to involve altered synaptic connectivity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Given the central role that layer 3 pyramidal neurons play in corticocortical and thalamocortical connectivity, we hypothesized that the excitatory inputs to these neurons are altered in subjects with schizophrenia.Methods
To test this hypothesis, we determined the density of dendritic spines, markers of excitatory inputs, on the basilar dendrites of Golgi-impregnated pyramidal neurons in the superficial and deep portions of layer 3 in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (area 46) and in layer 3 of the primary visual cortex (area 17) of 15 schizophrenic subjects, 15 normal control subjects, and 15 nonschizophrenic subjects with a psychiatric illness (referred to as psychiatric subjects).Results
There was a significant effect of diagnosis on spine density only for deep layer 3 pyramidal neurons in area 46 (P = .006). In the schizophrenic subjects, spine density on these neurons was decreased by 23\% and 16\% compared with the normal control (P = .004) and psychiatric (P = .08) subjects, respectively. In contrast, spine density on neurons in superficial layer 3 in area 46 (P = .09) or in area 17 (P = .08) did not significantly differ across the 3 subject groups. Furthermore, spine density on deep layer 3 neurons in area 46 did not significantly (P = .81) differ between psychiatric subjects treated with antipsychotic agents and normal controls.Conclusion
This region- and disease-specific decrease in dendritic spine density on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex layer 3 pyramidal cells is consistent with the hypothesis that the number of cortical and/or thalamic excitatory inputs to these neurons is altered in subjects with schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {Background
Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are severe psychiatric diseases with overlapping symptomatology. Widespread brain morphologic abnormalities, including cortical thinning and subcortical volume reductions, have been demonstrated in schizophrenia but it is unclear whether similar abnormalities are present in bipolar disorder. The purpose of this study was to compare cortical thickness and subcortical volumes in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, to assess differences and similarities in cortical and subcortical brain structure.
Methods
We analyzed magnetic resonance images from a sample of 173 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder, 139 patients with bipolar disorder, and 207 healthy control subjects. Cortical thickness was compared between the groups in multiple locations across the continuous cortical surface. Subcortical volumes were compared on a structure-by-structure basis.
Results
There was widespread cortical thinning in schizophrenia compared with control subjects, in frontal, temporal, occipital, and smaller parietal regions. There was no cortical thinning in bipolar disorder compared with control subjects or in schizophrenia compared with bipolar disorder. However, the subgroup of patients with bipolar disorder Type 1 showed cortical thinning, primarily in the frontal lobes and superior temporal and temporoparietal regions. Both patient groups showed substantial subcortical volume reductions bilaterally in the hippocampus, the left thalamus, the right nucleus accumbens, the left cerebellar cortex, and the brainstem, along with substantial ventricular enlargements.
Conclusions
We found substantial overlap in the underlying brain morphologic abnormalities in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in subcortical structures, and between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder Type 1 in the cerebral cortex.},

  abstract = {Background
Persistent formal thought disorder (FTD) is one of the most characteristic features of schizophrenia. Several neuroimaging studies report spatially distinct neuroanatomical changes in association with FTD. Given that most studies so far have employed a univariate localisation approach that obscures the study of covarying interregional relationships, the present study focussed on the multivariate systemic pattern of anatomical changes that contribute to FTD.
Methods
Speech samples from nineteen medicated clinically stable schizophrenia patients and 20 healthy controls were evaluated for subtle formal thought disorder. Ultra high-field (7 T) anatomical Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans were obtained from all subjects. Multivariate morphometric patterns were identified using an independent component approach (source based morphometry). Using multiple regression analysis, the morphometric patterns predicting positive and negative FTD scores were identified.
Results
Morphometric variations in grey matter predicted a substantial portion of inter-individual variance in negative but not positive FTD. A pattern of concomitant striato-insular/precuneus reduction along with frontocingular grey matter increase had a significant association with negative FTD.
Conclusions
These results suggest that concomitant increase and decrease in grey matter occur in association with persistent negative thought disorder in clinically stable individuals with schizophrenia.},

From a neurobiological point of view, they are of particular interest since both can be attributed to the language domain of human communication. In the last decade, brain imaging studies have contributed to the understanding of the functional dynamics underlying these phenomena. In particular, auditory hallucinations were found to involve the regions generating inner speech as well as the primary acoustical cortex and the intrahemispheric fiber bundles connecting the left frontal with the temporal lobe. In patients with formal thought disorders, on the other hand, the left temporal language area showed structural deficits and functional abnormalities, i.e., reduced reactivity to stimulation and increased activity at rest; left frontal language regions were also hyperactive at rest but showed no structural deficits. The available evidence indicates a dynamic imbalance of the language system, triggered by subtle structural changes, as the possible common neurobiological basis of hallucinations and formal thought disorders.},

  abstract = {Background
Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) and formal thought disorder (FTD) may originate from the same aberration in the language system. The hypothesis of a shared neurobiological basis would be strengthened by the presence of FTD in individuals who frequently experience AVH, but do not meet DSM-IV criteria for a psychotic disorder.
Methods
In this study, FTD was quantified in 40 non-clinical subjects with AVH, in 50 healthy subjects without AVH and in 40 schizophrenia patients with AVH. Recorded speech samples were analysed by one rater who was blind to the presence/absence of AVH and to diagnosis, using the Thought and Language Index.
Results
Negative FTD was barely present in non-clinical subjects with AVH and in healthy controls without AVH. Positive FTD, however, was significantly higher in both groups experiencing AVH than in controls without AVH. Severity of positive FTD did not differ significantly between non-clinical subjects with AVH and schizophrenia patients with AVH.
Conclusion
Negative FTD (alogia) appears not to be associated with AVH. However, the fact that positive FTD (disorganised speech) in schizophrenia patients with AVH is equally high in non-clinical subjects with AVH indicates that these two symptoms tend to co-occur, which may be suggestive of a shared neurobiological substrate.},

Another important framework in computational neuroscience, rate-coded neural networks, is mostly difficult or impossible to implement using these simulators. We present here the ANNarchy (Artificial Neural Networks architect) neural simulator, which allows to easily define and simulate rate-coded and spiking networks, as well as combinations of both. The interface in Python has been designed to be close to the PyNN interface, while the definition of neuron and synapse models can be specified using an equation-oriented mathematical description similar to the Brian neural simulator. This information is used to generate C++ code that will efficiently perform the simulation on the chosen parallel hardware (multi-core system or graphical processing unit). Several numerical methods are available to transform ordinary differential equations into an efficient C++ code. We compare the parallel performance of the simulator to existing solutions.},

Stepping the membrane potential from a hyperpolarized level to a value in the neighbourhood of resting potential (−35 to −50 mV at 5° C) results in an outward current transient, IA, which is apparently carried by potassium ions. 3. The peak amplitude of IA is dependent upon both the holding voltage level and the test step voltage while the time courses of development and decay are independent of, or only slightly dependent on, these parameters. 4. The developing and decaying phases of IA are approximated by exponentials, leading to time constants for development of 10–25 msec and for decay of 220–600 msec over the aggregate of cells studied (data at 5° C). Q10 for the processes is approximately 3. 5. It is concluded that the transport mechanism for IA is at least operationally distinct from the mechanism underlying delayed outward current, IK.},

Furthermore, it is possible to provide a reliable theory for the behaviour of the closely related implicit Euler method, as well as the Euler method itself. This chapter considers generalizations of the Euler Method, which will yield improved numerical behaviour but will retain its characteristic property of simplicity. The idea of extending the Euler method by allowing the approximate solution at a point to depend on the solution values and the derivative values at several previous step values is now known as the Adams-Bashforth method. Many differential equation solvers have been constructed, based on a variety of computational schemes, from Runge-Kutta and linear multistep methods to Taylor series and extrapolation methods. One can equip an Almost Runge-Kutta method with local error estimation, variable stepsize and interpolation.},

Although models themselves can be complex, oftenmany mental resources are wasted working around complexities of the software ecosystemsuch as fighting to manage files, interfacing between tools and data formats, finding mistakesin code or working out the units of variables. morphforge is a high-level, Python toolboxfor building and managing simulations of small populations of multicompartmental biophysicalmodel neurons. An entire in silico experiment, including the definition of neuronal morphologies,channel descriptions, stimuli, visualisation and analysis of results can be written within a singleshort Python script using high-level objects. Multiple independent simulations can be createdand run from a single script, allowing parameter spaces to be investigated. Consideration hasbeen given to the reuse of both algorithmic and parameterisable components to allow bothspecific and stochastic parameter variations. Some other features of the toolbox include: theautomatic generation of human-readable documentation (e. g. PDF-files) about a simulation; thetransparent handling of different biophysical units; a novel mechanism for plotting simulationresults based on a system of tags; and an architecture that supports both the use of establishedformats for defining channels and synapses (e. g. MODL files), and the possibility to supportother libraries and standards easily. We hope that this toolbox will allow scientists to quicklybuild simulations of multicompartmental model neurons for research and serve as a platform forfurther tool development.},

For a nominal familywise error rate of 5\%, the parametric statistical methods are shown to be conservative for voxelwise inference and invalid for clusterwise inference. Our results suggest that the principal cause of the invalid cluster inferences is spatial autocorrelation functions that do not follow the assumed Gaussian shape. By comparison, the nonparametric permutation test is found to produce nominal results for voxelwise as well as clusterwise inference. These findings speak to the need of validating the statistical methods being used in the field of neuroimaging.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, computational methods have radically changed the ability of researchers from all areas of scholarship to process and analyze data and to simulate complex systems. But with these advances come challenges that are contributing to broader concerns over irreproducibility in the scholarly literature, among them the lack of transparency in disclosure of computational methods. Current reporting methods are often uneven, incomplete, and still evolving. We present a novel set of Reproducibility Enhancement Principles (REP) targeting disclosure challenges involving computation. These recommendations, which build upon more general proposals from the Transparency and Openness Promotion (TOP) guidelines (1) and recommendations for field data (2), emerged from workshop discussions among funding agencies, publishers and journal editors, industry participants, and researchers representing a broad range of domains. Although some of these actions may be aspirational, we believe it is important to recognize and move toward ameliorating irreproducibility in computational research.

  title = {Code {{Readability Testing}}, an {{Empirical Study}}},
  doi = {10.1109/CSEET.2016.36},
  abstract = {Context: One of the factors that leads to improved code maintainability is its readability. When code is difficult to read, it is difficult for subsequent developers to understand its flow and its side effects. They are likely to introduce new bugs while trying to fix old bugs or adding new features. But how do software developers know they have written readable code? Objective: This paper presents a new technique, Code Readability Testing, to determine whether code is readable and evaluates whether the technique increases programmers' ability to write readable code. Method: The researcher conducted a field study using 21 software engineering master students and followed the Code Readability Testing with each student in four separate sessions evaluating different "production ready" software. After the observations, a questionnaire evaluated the programmer's perspective. Results: By following Code Readability Testing, half of the programmers writing "unreadable" code started writing "readable" code after four sessions. Programmers writing "readable" code also improved their ability to write readable code. The study reveals that the most frequent suggestions for increasing code readability are improving variable names, improving method names, creating new methods in order to reduce code duplication, simplifying if conditions and structures, and simplifying loop conditions. The programmers report that readability testing is worth their time. They observe increases in their ability to write readable code. When programmers experience a reader struggling to understand their code, they become motivated to write readable code. Conclusion: This paper defines code readability, demonstrates that Code Readability Testing improves programmers' ability to write readable code, and identifies frequent fixes needed to improve code readability.},

  abstract = {Source code readability is critical to software quality assurance and maintenance. In this paper, we present a novel approach to the automated measurement of source code readability based on Word Concreteness and Memory Retention (WCMR) of variable names. The approach considers programming and maintenance as processes of organizing variables and their operations to describe solutions to specific problems. The overall readability of given source code is calculated from the readability of all variables contained in the source code. The readability of each variable is determined by how easily its meaning is memorized (i.e., word concreteness) and how quickly they are forgotten over time (i.e., memory retention). Our empirical study has used 14 open source applications with over a half-million lines of code and 10,000 warning defects. The result shows that the WCMR-based source code readability negatively correlates strongly with overall warning defect rates, and particularly with such warning as bad programming practices, code vulnerability, and correctness bug warning.},

The first improvement takes advantage of the essentially tridiagonal character of the matrix equation for each branch of a ‘tree’ network and solves the equations as efficiently as for an unbranched cable. The second improvement evaluates the HH membrane conductances at the midpoint of a time step, Δt, to maintain full second order accuracy, 0(Δt2), with no increase in the number of computational steps. The third improvement makes use of ‘premultiplied’ HH rate function tables for very efficient second order correct integration of HH membrane conductance.},

For each simulation tool, its advantages and pitfalls are reviewed, with an aim to allow the reader to identify which simulator is appropriate for a given task. Finally, we provide a series of benchmark simulations of different types of networks of spiking neurons, including Hodgkin–Huxley type, integrate-and-fire models, interacting with current-based or conductance-based synapses, using clock-driven or event-driven integration strategies. The same set of models are implemented on the different simulators, and the codes are made available.

We have generated a database of about 1.7 million single-compartment model neurons by independently varying 8 maximal membrane conductances based on measurements from lobster stomatogastric neurons. We classified the spontaneous electrical activity of each model neuron and its responsiveness to inputs during runtime with an adaptive algorithm and saved a reduced version of each neuron's activity pattern. Our analysis of the distribution of different activity types (silent, spiking, bursting, irregular) in the 8-dimensional conductance space indicates that the coarse grid of conductance values we chose is sufficient to capture the salient features of the distribution. The database can be searched for different combinations of neuron properties such as activity type, spike or burst frequency, resting potential, frequency-current relation, and phase-response curve. We demonstrate how the database can be screened for models that reproduce the behavior of a specific biological neuron and show that the contents of the database can give insight into the way a neuron's membrane conductances determine its activity pattern and response properties. Similar databases can be constructed to explore parameter spaces in multicompartmental models or small networks, or to examine the effects of changes in the voltage dependence of currents. In all cases, database searches can provide insight into how neuronal and network properties depend on the values of the parameters in the models.},

  abstract = {Different modulatory inputs commonly elicit distinct rhythmic motor patterns from a central pattern generator (CPG), but they can instead elicit the same pattern. We are determining the rhythm-generating mechanisms in this latter situation, using the gastric mill (chewing) CPG in the crab (Cancer borealis) stomatogastric ganglion, where stimulating the projection neuron MCN1 (modulatory commissural neuron 1) or bath applying CabPK (C. borealis pyrokinin) peptide elicits the same gastric mill motor pattern, despite configuring different gastric mill circuits. In both cases, the core rhythm generator includes the same reciprocally inhibitory neurons LG (lateral gastric) and Int1 (interneuron 1), but the pyloric (food-filtering) circuit pacemaker neuron AB (anterior burster) is additionally necessary only for CabPK rhythm generation. MCN1 drives this rhythm generator by activating in the LG neuron the modulator-activated inward current (IMI), which waxes and wanes periodically due to phasic feedback inhibition of MCN1 transmitter release. Each buildup of IMI enables the LG neuron to generate a self-terminating burst and thereby alternate with Int1 activity. Here we establish that CabPK drives gastric mill rhythm generation by activating in the LG neuron IMI plus a slowly activating transient, low-threshold inward current (ITrans-LTS) that is voltage, time, and Ca(2+) dependent. Unlike MCN1, CabPK maintains a steady IMI activation, causing a subthreshold depolarization in LG that facilitates a periodic postinhibitory rebound burst caused by the regular buildup and decay of the availability of ITrans-LTS. Thus, different modulatory inputs can use different rhythm-generating mechanisms to drive the same neuronal rhythm. Additionally, the same ionic current (IMI) can play different roles under these different conditions, while different currents (IMI, ITrans-LTS) can play the same role.},

The strength of each synapse is modified as a function of the global activity of the postsynaptic neuron and by correlated activity of the pre- and postsynaptic neurons. This allows the self-assembly, from random initial synaptic strengths, of two cells into reciprocal oscillation and three cells into a rhythmic triphasic motor pattern. This self-assembly illustrates that complex oscillatory circuits that depend on multiple inhibitory synaptic connections can be tuned via simple activity-dependent rules.},

  abstract = {Electrical coupling between neurons with similar properties is often studied. Nonetheless, the role of electrical coupling between neurons with widely different intrinsic properties also occurs, but is less well understood. Inspired by the pacemaker group of the crustacean pyloric network, we developed a multicompartment, conductance-based model of a small network of intrinsically distinct, electrically coupled neurons. In the pyloric network, a small intrinsically bursting neuron, through gap junctions, drives 2 larger, tonically spiking neurons to reliably burst in-phase with it. Each model neuron has 2 compartments, one responsible for spike generation and the other for producing a slow, large-amplitude oscillation. We illustrate how these compartments interact and determine the dynamics of the model neurons. Our model captures the dynamic oscillation range measured from the isolated and coupled biological neurons. At the network level, we explore the range of coupling strengths for which synchronous bursting oscillations are possible. The spatial segregation of ionic currents significantly enhances the ability of the 2 neurons to burst synchronously, and the oscillation range of the model pacemaker network depends not only on the strength of the electrical synapse but also on the identity of the neuron receiving inputs. We also compare the activity of the electrically coupled, distinct neurons with that of a network of coupled identical bursting neurons. For small to moderate coupling strengths, the network of identical elements, when receiving asymmetrical inputs, can have a smaller dynamic range of oscillation than that of its constituent neurons in isolation.},

  abstract = {Insects are favoured objects for studying information processing in restricted neuronal networks, e.g. motor pattern generation or sensory perception. The analysis of the underlying processes requires knowledge of the electrical properties of the cells involved. These properties are determined by the expression pattern of ionic channels and by the regulation of their function, e.g. by neuromodulators. We here review the presently available knowledge on insect non-synaptic ion channels and ionic currents in neurons and skeletal muscles. The first part of this article covers genetic and structural informations, the localization of channels, their electrophysiological and pharmacological properties, and known effects of second messengers and modulators such as neuropeptides or biogenic amines. In a second part we describe in detail modulation of ionic currents in three particularly well investigated preparations, i.e. Drosophila photoreceptor, cockroach DUM (dorsal unpaired median) neuron and locust jumping muscle. Ion channel structures are almost exclusively known for the fruitfly Drosophila, and most of the information on their function has also been obtained in this animal, mainly based on mutational analysis and investigation of heterologously expressed channels. Now the entire genome of Drosophila has been sequenced, it seems almost completely known which types of channel genes — and how many of them — exist in this animal. There is much knowledge of the various types of channels formed by 6-transmembrane — spanning segments (6TM channels) including those where four 6TM domains are joined within one large protein (e.g. classical Na+ channel). In comparison, two TM channels and 4TM (or tandem) channels so far have hardly been explored. There are, however, various well characterized ionic conductances, e.g. for Ca2+, Cl− or K+, in other insect preparations for which the channels are not yet known. In some of the larger insects, i.e. bee, cockroach, locust and moth, rather detailed information has been established on the role of ionic currents in certain physiological or behavioural contexts. On the whole, however, knowledge of non-synaptic ion channels in such insects is still fragmentary. Modulation of ion currents usually involves activation of more or less elaborate signal transduction cascades. The three detailed examples for modulation presented in the second part indicate, amongst other things, that one type of modulator usually leads to concerted changes of several ion currents and that the effects of different modulators in one type of cell may overlap. Modulators participate in the adaptive changes of the various cells responsible for different physiological or behavioural states. Further study of their effects on the single cell level should help to understand how small sets of cells cooperate in order to produce the appropriate output.},

  abstract = {Many nervous systems contain rhythmically active subnetworks that interact despite oscillating at widely different frequencies. The stomatogastric nervous system of the crab Cancer borealis produces a rapid pyloric rhythm and a considerably slower gastric mill rhythm. We construct and analyze a conductance-based compartmental model to explore the activation of the gastric mill rhythm by the modulatory commissural neuron 1 (MCN1). This model demonstrates that the period of the MCN1-activated gastric mill rhythm, which was thought to be determined entirely by the interaction of neurons in the gastric mill network, can be strongly influenced by inhibitory synaptic input from the pacemaker neuron of the fast pyloric rhythm, the anterior burster (AB) neuron. Surprisingly, the change of the gastric mill period produced by the pyloric input to the gastric mill system can be many times larger than the period of the pyloric rhythm itself. This model illustrates several mechanisms by which a fast oscillatory neuron may control the frequency of a much slower oscillatory network. These findings suggest that it is possible to modify the slow rhythm either by direct modulation or indirectly by modulating the faster rhythm.},

  abstract = {Synaptic depression is a form of short-term plasticity exhibited by many synapses. Nonetheless, the functional significance of synaptic depression in oscillatory networks is not well understood. We show that, in a recurrent inhibitory network that includes an intrinsic oscillator, synaptic depression can give rise to two distinct modes of network operation. When the maximal conductance of the depressing synapse is small, the oscillation period is determined by the oscillator component. Increasing the maximal conductance beyond a threshold value activates a positive-feedback mechanism that greatly enhances the synaptic strength. In this mode, the oscillation period is determined by the strength and dynamics of the depressing synapse. Because of the regenerative nature of the feedback mechanism, the circuit can be switched from one mode of operation to another by a very small change in the maximal conductance of the depressing synapse. Our model was inspired by experimental work on the pyloric network of the lobster. The pyloric network produces a simple motor rhythm generated by a pacemaker neuron that receives feedback inhibition from a depressing synapse. In some preparations, elimination of the synapse had no effect on the period of the rhythm, whereas in other preparations, there was a significant decrease in the period. We propose that the pyloric network can operate in either of the two modes suggested by the model, depending on the maximal conductance of the depressing synapse.},

Sodium currents were expressed in approximately 65\% of the neurons prepared from wild-type Drosophila embryos when examined at room temperature, 24 hr after plating. While current density was low, other features of the sodium current in wild-type neurons, including the voltage sensitivity, steady-state inactivation, macroscopic time course, and TTX sensitivity were similar to those found in other excitable cells. Physiological and biochemical evidence has led to the suggestion that mutations in the nap, seizure, and tip-E loci of Drosophila may affect voltage-dependent sodium channels. There was no significant difference in the percentage of neurons expressing sodium currents in cultures prepared from embryos with mutations at the nap, sei or tip-E loci compared with wild-type cultures. Sodium currents recorded from napts appeared similar in all of the properties examined to those in wild-type cells. However, neuronal sodium current density was 40-60\% lower in cultures prepared from both tip-E and seits1 embryos. The voltage dependence and gating properties of these sodium channels, as well as the TTX sensitivity, appear similar to wild type. These results indicate that both the tip-E and sei loci are important in regulation of sodium current density in embryonic neurons.},

The first population consisted of 1000 model neurons with differing values of seven voltage-dependent conductances. In many of these models, increasing the sodium conductance threefold unexpectedly reduced the firing rate and divisively scaled the gain at high input current. In the second population, consisting of 1000 simplified model neurons, we found that enhanced sodium conductance changed the frequency–current (FI) curve in two computationally distinct ways, depending on the firing rate. In these models, increased sodium conductance produced a subtractive shift in the FI curve at low firing rates because the additional sodium conductance allowed the neuron to respond more strongly to equivalent input current. In contrast, at high input current, the increase in sodium conductance resulted in a divisive change in the gain because the increased conductance produced a proportionally larger activation of the delayed rectifier potassium conductance. The control and sodium-enhanced FI curves intersect at a point that delimits two regions in which the same biophysical manipulation produces two fundamentally different changes to the model neuron's computational properties. This suggests a potentially difficult problem for homeostatic regulation of intrinsic excitability.},

Starting from random initial conditions over a given range, the model sets the maximal conductances for its active membrane currents to values that produce a predefined target pattern of activity ∼90\% of the time. In these models, the same pattern of electrical activity can be produced by a range of maximal conductances, and this range is compared with voltage-clamp data from the lateral pyloric neuron of the STG. If the electrical activity of the model neuron is perturbed, the maximal conductances adjust to restore the original pattern of activity. When the perturbation is removed, the activity pattern is again restored after a transient adjustment period, but the conductances may not return to their initial values. The model suggests that neurons may regulate their conductances to maintain fixed patterns of electrical activity, rather than fixed maximal conductances, and that the regulation process requires feedback systems capable of reacting to changes of electrical activity on a number of different time scales.$<$/p$>$},

  abstract = {Activity of voltage-gated Na channels (Nav) is modified by alternative splicing. However, whether altered splicing of human Navs contributes to epilepsy remains to be conclusively shown. We show here that altered splicing of the Drosophila Nav (paralytic, DmNav) contributes to seizure-like behavior in identified seizure mutants. We focus attention on a pair of mutually exclusive alternate exons (termed K and L), which form part of the voltage sensor (S4) in domain III of the expressed channel. The presence of exon L results in a large, non-inactivating, persistent INap. Many forms of human epilepsy are associated with an increase in this current. In wild-type (WT) Drosophila larvae, ∼70–80\% of DmNav transcripts contain exon L, and the remainder contain exon K. Splicing of DmNav to include exon L is increased to ∼100\% in both the slamdance and easily-shocked seizure mutants. This change to splicing is prevented by reducing synaptic activity levels through exposure to the antiepileptic phenytoin or the inhibitory transmitter GABA. Conversely, enhancing synaptic activity in WT, by feeding of picrotoxin is sufficient to increase INap and promote seizure through increased inclusion of exon L to 100\%. We also show that the underlying activity-dependent mechanism requires the presence of Pasilla, an RNA-binding protein. Finally, we use computational modeling to show that increasing INap is sufficient to potentiate membrane excitability consistent with a seizure phenotype. Thus, increased synaptic excitation favors inclusion of exon L, which, in turn, further increases neuronal excitability. Thus, at least in Drosophila, this self-reinforcing cycle may promote the incidence of seizure.},

The results are presented in the context of half-center oscillators, which are simple rhythmic circuits composed of two reciprocally connected inhibitory neuronal populations. Specifically, we focus on rhythms that rely on a particular excitability property, the postinhibitory rebound, an intrinsic cellular property that elicits transient membrane depolarization when released from hyperpolarization. Two distinct ionic currents can evoke this transient depolarization: a hyperpolarization-activated cation current and a low-threshold T-type calcium current. The presence of a slow activation is specific to the T-type calcium current and provides a slow positive feedback at the cellular level that is absent in the cation current. We show that this slow positive feedback is required to endow the network rhythm with physiological modulation and robustness properties. This study thereby identifies an essential cellular property to be retained at the network level in modeling network robustness and modulation.},

  abstract = {The electrical characteristics of many neurons are remarkably robust in the face of changing internal and external conditions. At the same time, neurons can be highly sensitive to neuromodulators. We find correlates of this dual robustness and sensitivity in a global analysis of the structure of a conductance-based model neuron. We vary the maximal conductance parameters of the model neuron and, for each set of parameters tested, characterize the activity pattern generated by the cell as silent, tonically firing, or bursting. Within the parameter space of the five maximal conductances of the model, we find directions, representing concerted changes in multiple conductances, along which the basic pattern of neural activity does not change. In other directions, relatively small concurrent changes in a few conductances can induce transitions between these activity patterns. The global structure of the conductance-space maps implies that neuromodulators that alter a sensitive set of conductances will have powerful, and possibly state-dependent, effects. Other modulators that may have no direct impact on the activity of the neuron may nevertheless change the effects of such direct modulators via this state dependence. Some of the results and predictions arising from the model studies are replicated and verified in recordings of stomatogastric ganglion neurons using the dynamic clamp.},

Whole-cell recordings reveal a rapidly inactivating A current that is absent in Shaker mutants and that can be readily isolated in cell-attached patches. Although very similar to their muscle counterparts, the photoreceptor A channels show a striking 40–50 mV negative shift in their voltage-operating range. Two mutations (ShE62 and T(1;Y)W32), which exclude only certain classes of Shaker transcripts, were used to show that photoreceptor A channels are encoded by multiple transcripts distinct from those encoding muscle A channels, while PCR techniques identified four transcripts (ShAl, ShA2, ShG1, and ShG2) in mRNA from dissected retina.},

  abstract = {Modulation is essential for adjusting neurons to prevailing conditions and differing demands. Yet understanding how modulators adjust neuronal properties to alter information processing remains unclear, as is the impact of neuromodulation on energy consumption. Here we combine two computational models, one Hodgkin-Huxley type and the other analytic, to investigate the effects of neuromodulation upon Drosophila melanogaster photoreceptors. Voltage-dependent K+ conductances: (i) activate upon depolarisation to reduce membrane resistance and adjust bandwidth to functional requirements; (ii) produce negative feedback to increase bandwidth in an energy efficient way; (iii) produce shunt-peaking thereby increasing the membrane gain bandwidth product; and (iv) inactivate to amplify low frequencies. Through their effects on the voltage-dependent K+ conductances, three modulators, serotonin, calmodulin and PIP2, trade-off voltage-contrast gain against membrane bandwidth. Serotonin shifts the photoreceptor performance towards higher voltage-contrast gains and lower membrane bandwidths, whereas PIP2 and calmodulin shifts performance towards lower voltage-contrast gains and higher membrane bandwidths. These neuromodulators have little effect upon the overall energy consumed by photoreceptors, instead they redistribute the energy invested in gain versus bandwidth. This demonstrates how modulators can shift neuronal information processing within the limitations of biophysics and energy consumption.},

The biological neurons are recorded in current-clamp with pink (1/f) noise injected to perturb the activity of the neuron. The new algorithm finds a set of parameters that allows a multicompartmental model neuron to match the recorded voltage trace. Attempting to match a recorded voltage trace directly has a well-known problem: mismatch in the timing of action potentials between biological and model neuron is inevitable and results in poor phenomenological match between the model and data. Our approach avoids this by applying a weak control adjustment to the model to promote alignment during the fitting procedure. This approach is closely related to the control theoretic concept of a Luenberger observer. We tested this approach on synthetic data and on data recorded from an anterior gastric receptor neuron from the stomatogastric ganglion of the crab Cancer borealis. To test the flexibility of this approach, the synthetic data were constructed with conductance models that were different from the ones used in the fitting model. For both synthetic and biological data, the resultant models had good spike-timing accuracy.},

  abstract = {Drosophila ether-à-go-go (eag) is the founding member of a large family of voltage-gated K+ channels, the KCNH family, which includes Kv10, 11, and 12. Concurrent binding of calcium/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) to NH2- and COOH-terminal sites inhibits mammalian EAG1 channels at submicromolar Ca2+ concentrations, likely by causing pore constriction. Although the Drosophila EAG channel was believed to be Ca2+-insensitive (Schönherr R, Löber K, Heinemann SH. EMBO J 19: 3263–3271, 2000.), both the NH2- and COOH-terminal sites are conserved. In this study we show that Drosophila EAG is inhibited by high Ca2+ concentrations that are only present at plasma membrane Ca2+ channel microdomains. To test the role of this regulation in vivo, we engineered mutations that block CaM-binding to the major COOH-terminal site of the endogenous eag locus, disrupting Ca2+-dependent inhibition. eag CaMBD mutants have reduced evoked release from larval motor neuron presynaptic terminals and show decreased Ca2+ influx in stimulated adult projection neuron presynaptic terminals, consistent with an increase in K+ conductance. These results are predicted by a conductance-based multicompartment model of the presynaptic terminal in which some fraction of EAG is localized to the Ca2+ channel microdomains that control neurotransmitter release. The reduction of release in the larval neuromuscular junction drives a compensatory increase in motor neuron somatic excitability. This misregulation of synaptic and somatic excitability has consequences for systems-level processes and leads to defects in associative memory formation in adults.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Regulation of excitability is critical to tuning the nervous system for complex behaviors. We demonstrate in this article that the EAG family of voltage-gated K+ channels exhibit conserved gating by Ca2+/CaM. Disruption of this inhibition in Drosophila results in decreased evoked neurotransmitter release due to truncated Ca2+ influx in presynaptic terminals. In adults, disrupted Ca2+ dynamics cripples memory formation. These data demonstrate that the biophysical details of channels have important implications for cell function and behavior.},

With an internal current electrode effective resistance of 2 ohm cm.2, the membrane potential and current may be constant within a few millivolts and 10 per cent out to near the electrode ends. The maximum membrane current patterns of the best axons are several times larger but of the type described by Cole and analyzed by Hodgkin and Huxley when the change of potential is adequately controlled. The occasional obvious distortions are attributed to the marginal adequacy of potential control to be expected from the characteristics of the current electrodes and the axon. Improvements are expected only to increase stability and accuracy.

Although not a new area, it is only recently that enough knowledge has been gathered to establish computational neuroscience as a scientific discipline in its own right. Given the complexity of the field, and its increasing importance in progressing our understanding of how the brain works, there has long been a need for an introductory text on what is often assumed to be an impenetrable topic. The new edition of Fundamentals of Computational Neuroscience build on the success and strengths of the first edition. It introduces the theoretical foundations of neuroscience with a focus on the nature of information processing in the brain. The book covers the introduction and motivation of simplified models of neurons that are suitable for exploring information processing in large brain-like networks. Additionally, it introduces several fundamental network architectures and discusses their relevance for information processing in the brain, giving some examples of models of higher-order cognitive functions to demonstrate the advanced insight that can be gained with such studies. Each chapter starts by introducing its topic with experimental facts and conceptual questions related to the study of brain function. An additional feature is the inclusion of simple Matlab programs that can be used to explore many of the mechanisms explained in the book. An accompanying webpage includes programs for download. The book is aimed at those within the brain and cognitive sciences, from graduate level and upwards"--Provided by publisher},

  abstract = {How do neurons develop, control, and maintain their electrical signaling properties in spite of ongoing protein turnover and perturbations to activity? From generic assumptions about the molecular biology underlying channel expression, we derive a simple model and show how it encodes an “activity set point” in single neurons. The model generates diverse self-regulating cell types and relates correlations in conductance expression observed in vivo to underlying channel expression rates. Synaptic as well as intrinsic conductances can be regulated to make a self-assembling central pattern generator network; thus, network-level homeostasis can emerge from cell-autonomous regulation rules. Finally, we demonstrate that the outcome of homeostatic regulation depends on the complement of ion channels expressed in cells: in some cases, loss of specific ion channels can be compensated; in others, the homeostatic mechanism itself causes pathological loss of function.},

  abstract = {Experimental observations reveal that the expression levels of different ion channels vary across neurons of a defined type, even when these neurons exhibit stereotyped electrical properties. However, there are robust correlations between different ion channel expression levels, although the mechanisms that determine these correlations are unknown. Using generic model neurons, we show that correlated conductance expression can emerge from simple homeostatic control mechanisms that couple expression rates of individual conductances to cellular readouts of activity. The correlations depend on the relative rates of expression of different conductances. Thus, variability is consistent with homeostatic regulation and the structure of this variability reveals quantitative relations between regulation dynamics of different conductances. Furthermore, we show that homeostatic regulation is remarkably insensitive to the details that couple the regulation of a given conductance to overall neuronal activity because of degeneracy in the function of multiple conductances and can be robust to "antihomeostatic" regulation of a subset of conductances expressed in a cell.},

The expressiveness, power and ease-of-use of the simulator interface is critical in efficiently and accurately translating ideas into a working simulation. We review long-term trends in the development of programmable simulator interfaces, and examine the benefits of moving from proprietary, domain-specific languages to modern dynamic general-purpose languages, in particular Python, which provide neuroscientists with an interactive and expressive simulation development environment and easy access to state-of-the-art general-purpose tools for scientific computing.},
